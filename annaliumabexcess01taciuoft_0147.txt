when we ask definite questions—Did he poison Drusus? Did he bring
about the retirement to Capreae( Did he compass the fall of the family
of Germanicus? Did he conspire against his master's life ?--we see
that the positive evidence is weak. The first charge, testing, it would
seem, only on the evidence of tortured slaves ¹, was preferred eight
years afterwards by Apicata, whose knowledge could but have been
at second hand ¹, and who had every motive for aiming a deadly blow
D at her rival Livilla, at a time when any genuine investigation was im·
poosible. On the second question, we have the doubts of Tacitus
limeis, who suggests other motives for our consideration ⁸. On the
third, the loss of the Fifth Book makes our knowledge most imperfect ;
but the actual charges against Agrippina and Nero, as has been already
sbown⁴, bear no evident marks of fabrication or even exaggeration;
and the evident animosity underlying them may be as probably as·
signed to the suspicions nature of Tiberius himself, as to the prompt-
ἶ ing! of his minister. The final conspiracy, though related as an un·
doubted fact by Josephus ⁸, and evidently believed by Tacitus· as well
as Suetonius '. would yet seem to have been disbelieved by those whom
Dio has followed ⁸, and certainly never to have been formally proved
to the senate which condemned’; and. more strangely still, to have
Ἴ been ignored by Tiberius himself, when seeking to justify the exe-
ξ cution to posterity ¹⁰.
ἒ On the other hand, if the generally unscrupulous and ambitious

ξ from the concentration of the guards to the final plot, appears to follow
obviously from what had preceded it; ιο be suggested by an adequate
notive 3 to be the natural step to take at that particular stage. lf
ξ therefore the familiar story of his career is left ιο stand, it would seem
Ξ ιο be one of those enses in which a history. by its thorough coherency
ond intrinsic probability, appears to prove itself.
