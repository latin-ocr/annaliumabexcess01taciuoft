ἢ PREFACE

(Halle, 1831), and the valuable edition of Ruperti
(Hanover, 1834), in which all the Excursus of Lipsius,
and the chief results of the labour of other commen-
tators down to his date, are contained; while among the
later editors those most constantly consulted have been
Ritter (Cambridge, 1838), Orelli (2nd ed., by Baiter,
Zfirich, 1859), Draeger (Leipzig, 1868), and Nipperdey
(7th ed.‚ by Andresen, Berlin, 1879) ¹.

To all of these Ι am repeatedly and constantly in-
debted‚ especially to the edition last mentioned, to which
it is the more necessary for me here to acknowledge my
general obligation in the most emphatic manner, inas-
much as the special sources of each note are often too
complex to be easily stated.

Among separate works bearing on the criticism and
interpretation of the text, those chiefly used have been
the old ‘Lexicon Taciteum' of Bo‘tticher (Berlin, 1830),
and as much as has appeared of the complete and ex-
haustive new Lexicon of Gerber and Greef (Leipzig,
1 877—1 88 1)2, also Draeger’s valuable treatise ‘'uber Syntax
und Stil des Tacitus' (3rd ed., Leipzig, 1882), Pfitzner,
‘Die Annalen des Tacitus kritisch beleuchtet' (HallQ,
1869), Johann Muller, ‘Beitrage zur Kritik und Er-
klarung des Cornelius Tacitus’ (3rd section, Books I-VI,
Innsbruck, 1873), and dissertations by Ritter (Rhein.
Mus, 1861, 1862) ³, and by E. Wo'lfflin (Philologus, 1867,
1868, and Bursian's Jahresberichte‚ 1877) 4.

In illustration of the subject-matter, much use has
been made throughout of Mommsen's ‘ Romisches
