⁷ ROMF: UNDER AUGUSTUS ΛΝΒ TIBERIUS. 105

   
 

The old names ‘hastati,' ‘ principe& and ‘pilani,' survive¹; and,
Ἴ though no longer designating any difference of equipment‚ denote pre·
' cedence in honorary rank. Each cohort contained two centuries, or one
maniple, of each os ,these ς and the cohorts also rank in honour accord-
ing to their number. This hierarchy os rank serves to place the sixty
centurions in a constantly ascending series’; the maniple, rather than
the century, being the unit os the legion, and being under the command
ξ’ of the first os its two centurione. The lowest centurion would thus be
ἒ the subordinate centurion of the ‘ hastati ’ os the tenth cohort, styled

‘ decumus hastatus posterioris centuriae: or ‘ decumus hastatus posterior ; '

and the highest, the commander of the maniple os ‘pilani ' in the first

cohort, who wouldbe fully styled ‘primae cohortis pilus prior,' or more

oomonly ‘centurio primipilus' or ⁶ primopilus ⁸.’ In passing through

all these gradatione, the centurion changed his century at each successive
·- παρ’, and in this highest position had custody of the legionary eagle,
g with large accompanying emolumenta ⁸; ranked next to the ‘tribuni; ’ and
ξ wat admitted with them to the council of the general ⁸. The centurions
appear to have still appointed their subordinate officers ¹, but to bave
been themselves nov directly appointed by Caesar, osten as a personal
,f favour ⁸, and, apparently, without previous service ⁹.

Angustus had perpetuated the custom introduced by the dictator
cmv, os placing the whole legion under the command osa ‘legatus.'
The-e ⁸ legati legionum ¹¹ ¹ are senators os praetorian rank, or in a position
to expect such rank ²¹, and, as has been seen, ranked also as provincial
vicegerenta under the ⁴ legatus Augusti ¹'.'

The position os the legionary ‘tribuni militum ⁹ now becomes some-
’ what anomalous; inasmuch as they are no longer, as formerly, com-
’ mandet: in turn os the legion ¹⁴, and several os their other duties ¹⁸ must
, have been transferred to the · praefectus castrorum ¹⁸.' Nor do they
appear to have commanded the legionary echon-ts, which, so sar as they
had a separate command, were probably placed each under its first cen·
