CORNELII TACITI ANNALJUM [A.U.C.'7‘67.

domus, ne consilia amicorum, ministeria militurn vulgarentur,
neve Tiberius vim principatus resolveret cuncta ad senatum
vocando: eam condicionem esse imperandi, ut non aliter ratio

constet quam si uni reddatur.

’1. At Romae ruere in servitium consules, patres, eques.1
quanto quis inlustrior, tanto magis falsi ac festinantes, vultuque Β
composito, ne laeti excessu principis neu tristiores primordio,

lacrimas gaudium, questus adulationem miscebant.

peius et Sex. Appuleius consules primi in verba Tiberii Caesaris 8
'10 iuravere, apudque eos Seius Strabo et C. Turranius, ille prae·
toriarum cohortium praefectus, hic annonae3 mox senatus miles-

3. eam condicionem, ‘it istos the
essence of ruling, that accoun‘ffiill not
come right if audited by others than the
ruler.’ This may mean either that the
ruler must· give account of his actions to
no one; or that his subordinates, above
all h‘is military subordinates, to whom
Tiberius here professes to have given no
orders. must be responsible to him alone:
it is implied either way that much must
be done by or for an autocrat which will
not bear investigation. On ‘condicio,’
cp. ‘ condicio vivendi ’ Hor. Sat. 2. 8, 65.
The metaphor ‘ ratio constat' seems to
be suggested by ‘rationem reddendam:’
in Pl. Min.. e.g. in Epp. 1. 5, 173 1. 9,
1;‘ 2. 4. 4, etc.‚‘ ‘ratio constat’ comes
to mean ‘it is good,' or ‘it is reason-
able?

5. eonsules, patres, eques. On the use
of asyndeta‚ see Introd. v. ξ 65; on the
use of singular for plural, as in ‘eques‚‘
and, below, ‘miles‚’ see Id. ξ 2. The
collective sing. ‘eques’ is used of the
equestrian order in 4. 74, 5, ete„ also
isn Hor. (Epp. 2. 1, 185), Mart. and

'uet.

6. falsi, ‘hypocritical.’ as 3. 3, 1; 13.
13, 4, etc. The use seems taken from
Sall„ who has ‘ambitio multos mortales
falsos fieri subegit’ Cat. 10, 5.

7. composito, used of studied effeets
in word or look, as a. 34, 6; 3. 44, 4,
etc. ,
ne laeti. sc. ‘essent.' See Introd. v.

· 5 39 b, and Nipp. here.

8. Sex. Pompeius et Sex. Appuleius.
These consuls are stated by Dio (56.
33ιὶῑέιῖ ἕριὲῗέἒ &303332552152 &3323
throughout the year. PompeiuS, who is
mentioned 3. 11, ²5 32, 2, and as a

friend of Ovid (ex P. 4. 1, 4, 8), may
have shared in the relationship indicated
in 2. 27. 2. That of Appuleius may be
gathered from 2. 5ο, ι.

9. prima· . . . iuravere. This oath
(⁸ sacramentum in nomen Tiberii ’ c. 8. 5)
taken by the whole people‚ and by the
provinces (c. 34, 17,is a recognition of
Caesar’s sole ‘proconsulare imperium’
throughout the empire. See Introd. vi.
p. 7ο; Momms. Staatsr. ii. p. 768. It
must be distinguished from the oath
taken to maintain the acta (see c. 72, 2).
The consuls, as the chief senatorial “
trateS, appear here, after themselves
swearing allegiance, to administer the
oath to the two chief non-senatorial
officers (on whom see Introd. vi. p. 72).
All other magistrates pr praefecti appear
to take it only as members of the senate
or equestrian order. It is therefore
possible that the absence of separate
mention of the ‘praefectus nrbis,' who
was always a senator, may no more prove
that office to have been in abeyanoe thau
the regular senatorial magistracies (see
on 6. 11). The ‘praefectus vigilum' is
also unmentioned. ;

10. Seius Strabo, the father ofSeiauus ἶ
(c. 24, 3; 4. 1, 3). afterwards praefectus·
of Egypt (Dio, 57. 19, 6). His praeno-
men was Lucius (Insc. Henzen 5394).

0. Turranius, probably the first per· ᾗ

son appointed to the office, which was of
recent institution (Momms. p. 996). He

was still holding it thirty-four years later V
(11. 31, 1), though Seneca makes him 3
already ninety in the time of Gaius (Brev. ζ

Vit. 20, 2).

11. senatus milesque et. populus. 3
These are coupled as making up the ᾗέ
whole population‚ 11. 30, 5. ²
