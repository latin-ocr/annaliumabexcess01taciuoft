CONSTITUTION OF THE EARLV PRINCIPA TE. 69

    

not now always traceable3 besides which, other powers not clearly
'7 belonging to the idea of either os these offices, centre in the princeps,
conceived generally as the chief magistrate and representative os the
· state.
Ι. The ‘proconsulare imperium,’ as has been seen, must have been at
ι first no more than was involved in the charge taken sor ten years of *s
certain provinces& ⁸ Imperium' must belong to a definite magistracy5
all military command, from the time ol' Sulla, had been vested in pro-
ᾗ consuls or propraetors3 and the power given to Augustus would seem
j, only a step beyond several republican precedents2, and his own action
'- one οἱ surrender rather than aggrandisement³. But liis proconsular
, power soon became virtually, that os his successors even sormally,
perpetual ; and when, on the cessation of his consulships in 7 31, mc. 2 3,
it apparently first received formal definition, it was made coextensive
> with the empire‚ and valid even within the walls of Rome ⁴. By this act
¹ thesenate and people had surrendered the whole power of the sword into
his hands. Besides the command os his own provinces and his own
legati, he held now an ‘imperium maius' also over the proconsuls os *s
senatorial provinces “, supreme command even os troops under their
immediate orders ⁸, and the right to collect fisoal revenue there through
his own officers⁷ ς nor had proconsule power in their province over the
lire of a soldier ⁸. With him rest all ordinances respecting the levy,
payment, and dismissal οἷ troops, and regulation os the military hierarchy.
He levies war, makes peace or treaty ⁹, and represents the state in rela-
tion to all foreign or dependent powers. Again, he is the high adrniral
os the empire, with fleets near at hand ¹⁰; and, besides the troops attached
to these, not only the praetorian guard, his proper household brigade,
bnt even the police and night-watch os the city, owned no allegiance to
any magistrate of the republic, but only to Caesar and his prefects, and
(mmcd no insignificant force at his disposal on the spot ¹¹ ς while the
validity of his imperium within the walls explains his power to put to
death citizens even os senatorial rank ¹¹: and he is so far the ‘imperator'
