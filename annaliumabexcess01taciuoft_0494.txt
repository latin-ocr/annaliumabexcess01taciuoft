(Pl. N. H. 8. 48, 74, ¹95)-

3. antiqua munera. According to
Livy (30. 15, 11), Masinissa received
through Scipio the same gifts, with the
addition os a curule chair3 which was
also probably serit to Ptolemaeus, as it
is represented, with the sceptre, on his
coins (see Dict. of Biog.). Similar gifts
were sent to Porsena (Dion. Hal. 5. 35).
and probably to Ariovistus (Caes. B. G.

translation ‘extensive.' may perhaps de

from triremes (App. 111. 3; Luc. Phara.
