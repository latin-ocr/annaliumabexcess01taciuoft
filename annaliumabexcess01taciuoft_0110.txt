their compliments declined1. One genuine enthusiasm, that for Ger-
manicus and his house ², seems left to them; otherwise those for
whom none care, care for none; and find it their one sound instinct to
side with fortune and to hate the fallen ’ς worthy parents of those who,
half a century later, ‚looked on civil war in the streets as only a more
exciting gladiatorial combat ⁴.

ITALY.

Few changes of importance in the administration or condition of Italy
belong to this period. Augustus was but recognising facts already
accomplished, in fixing the western frontier of Italy at the line of the Varus
(Var)⁶ and of the small procuratorial province of the maritime Alps‘:
a small semi-independent state being reserved in the district of the Cottian

Alps round Segusium (Susa) near Turin ⁷. On the east, Istria was,

included, the Arsia (Arsa) being fixed as the boundary towards Illyricum ⁸.
Augustus had also given the peninsula its first organization as a whole,
by mapping it out into the eleven regions recorded by Pliny ⁹ 3 an
arrangement which, though probably intended only to facilitate a census,
became the permanent basis of its administration, which in other respects
appears to have undergone little change till the second century A.1>.¹⁰.
The probable population of Italy at this time can be barely guessed
at ¹¹3 but there is abundant evidence that the free rustic people, rapidly
diminishing as early as the time of the Gracchi ¹², and further thinned by
civil wars‚ had sunk far below the number that could have been employed
or supported ; probably even below the δεινὴ ὀλιγανθρωπία ²³ of the time of
the dictator Caesar. Strabo attests the depopulation of Southern Italy ¹⁴:
Livy is no less explicit on that of the central districts, and is amazed that
the country which once sent forth the Aequian and Volscian armies could
now barely recruit the household troops of Rome, and would be a desert,
but sor the slave-gangs ¹⁶: the most eloquent words ascribed by Tacitus
