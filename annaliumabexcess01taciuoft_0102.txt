rule to their subtle manipulation of republican ideas. Not even ‘the
extinction of the bolder spirits by proscription and battle ¹,’ and the growth
of ‘ a generation bent on slavery²‚' helped them more than the homage
paid at least in the letter to constitutional forms, the respect for which,
even in the character of fictions and survivals‚ is so marked a trait of the
Roman mind ; especially at a time when demoralisation and its remedies
were alike felt to be burdensome ³, and men could neither bear complete
bondage nor complete liberty ⁴. If Julius Caesar might have pleaded
that he had but gone a step further on the path of Sulla; Augustus, with
far more prudence, made a show of imitating the great autocrat of the
aristocracy only in his wish to abdicate 3 while ruling under more skilful
disguise‚ and with more complete precedents. Men might recollect‚ and
were, no doubt, industriously reminded, that even his more irregular
powers were severally such as their fathers had acquiesced in: that there
had always been a constitutional right to commend and to reJect can·
didates for a magistracy ⁵: that the senate had been always in theory no
more than an advising body: that a ‘ cohors praetoria ’ was as old as the
days of Scipio Africanus ⁶: that Gracchus had contemplated‚ and partly
realised, a continuity of ‘ tribunitian power: ' that Marius and Sulla, and
still more Pompeius, and yet more recently Cassius ⁷, had held an ‘ impe-
rium maius,' embracing more than a province z that Pompeius again, most
dangerous innovator of all, had been admiral of the state, with power to
send his fleets where he would⁸ 5 and had even been consul at home,

while holding ‘ proconsulare imperium ' abroad, administered by legati γ

in his name. It was by a strange irony of fate, that, not only demagogues‚
but even the last great champions of the ‘ optimates,’ supplied the leading
political ideas of the Caesars 3 and that it was by weapons drawn mainly
¹from its own armoury that the senatorial rule had perished.
