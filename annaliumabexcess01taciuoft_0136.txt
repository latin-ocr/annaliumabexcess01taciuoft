, to deal with them. It is in this mixture of strength and weakness ¹, as
well as in the union of his natural sels-distrust2, reserve, and austerity‚
with the souring experiences of a lisetime, that we find the leading trait:
of character of the future ruler.

Drusus superfuere.'

This period, the first eight years of this principate‚ treated by Tacitus
in the first three books, and reviewed at the beginning of the fourth, is at
once that on which his information is most suli, and his estimate most
questionable: the whole time being thus summarily dismissed, not as that
in which the purpose was most sincere, but in which the disguise was best
sustained.

The fact of generally just and moderate governrnent is admitted and
indisputable. We are told of constant consultation of the senate, even
on matters not strictly belonging to their cognisance⁸3 that its chief
members are encouraged to discuss, and rebuked for servility·⁴ ; that the
office of the magistrates of the republic is respected ⁵ ; the lawe, with one
exception ⁶, uprightly administered ; that in the bestowal of dignities 'the
worthiest were selected; that Tiberius set an example of frugality, both
in the moderate size and number of his Italian estates, amid the vast villas
of the nobles ⁷, and in unostentatious management and retinue ς as well
as an example of moderation in conducting disputes with other citizens
as between equals in the law—courts. It is further admitted that these
characteristics at home were accompanied by clemency and vigilance
abroad ε that no new burdens were laid on the provinces ς the old ones
adjusted with care and remitted on occasion ; personal violence and
confiscation scrupulously avoided; cruelty and extortion in govemors
duly punished3 fiscal procuratorships conferred on men of character,

even without personal knowledge ; and their tenure indefinitely extended, ’

as if to diminish temptation to peculation, by giving men time to grow
rich without it.

Many even of what seemed to Tacitus defects of policy, would be
merits to an impartial critic 3 who, for instance, would hardly be induced
to believe that Germanicus, whose chief recorded achievements are those
of mere ravage and massacre ⁸, or ostentatious and futile obsequies to the
