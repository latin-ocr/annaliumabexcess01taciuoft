discipline. Next to these, Egypt, with its vast granaries‚ strange sanati·
(τίως’, and the rnotley crowd of Alexandria, almost rivalling that of
Antioch ¹3 and Moesia and Pannonia, where Dacian bordes were already
beginning to be heard of on the Danube⁸; must have been the chief

objecta of solicitude to Caesar.

The amount of provincial revenue was probably not reduced, but the

mode of assessment reorganized⁴3 and, in general terms, it is admitted
J even by Tacitus, that the provinces were better off under the principate
² than under the Republic ⁶, and were treated with marked justice and

moderatiori during at least the early years of Tiberius·; and that the
Caesarian provinces were so far more economically governed than the
senatorial, that a change from one to the other was a virtual abatement
of tribute '. In both classes os provinces, extortion was severely checked ⁸
instead of being criminally connived at3 and governors were wamed to
eheu, not flay, their sheep ⁸, whose prosperity had become the common
interest os ruled and ruler.

Nevertheless, it is easy to exaggerate the beneficia! results and to
overlook the still existing evils ¹⁰. Conviction of the guilty did not
necessarily imply restitution to the pillaged ¹¹5 and the punishment
must have been osten inadequate ¹⁶, and have failed to deter others.
In the last years os Augustus, the atrocities of Volesus Messalla in
Asia¹⁸ were such as could hardly have been exceeded under the Re-
publicz in the same province, within the next ten years, another pro-
consulu and a procurator ¹⁸ are convieted os extortion ς and proconsuls
os two other provinces ¹⁶ are condemned on equally serious charges:
nor does Silius come with cleaner hands from Germany¹⁷2 in Spain
a legatus is assassinated through some money grievance, os which we
have only the Roman version ¹⁸: the Frisii are goaded into rebelIIon
