12. 41, 3; ‘acceperant’ 14. 53, 3, etc.
to the singular, is also found in ‘ caeri- 5. decoravere, ‘honoured by the
monia deorum' (Caes. ap. Suet. Jul. 6), grant.‘

‘legationis’ (Cic. Rosc. Amer. 39, 113), Leucophrynae. The MS. has

60. 3.

dicione, abl. of time: cp. Introd.
v. ξ 26.

2. post Macedonas, dein nos. Strabo
states (14. 1, 2 3, 641) that Alexander had
made the asylum extend for a stadium
round the temple; that Mithridates had
somewhat enlau ged it by making the limit
a bowsh0t; that Antonius had so ex-
tended it as to include part of the city3
and that Augustus, in consequence of
increased abuses, had curtailed it. The
περίβολος as fixed by him, and dated by
inscriptions styling him cos. xii. trib. pot.
‘xviii. (749, Β. e. 5‚) has been discovered
(see Wood Ephesus, Append. p. 2.)

3. Proximi hos. Halm and Orelli
follow Wurm. in extracting this reading
from the MS. corruption‘ proximo snag-
netes.' The construction is that found in
15. 15, 6, and in Plaut.‚ Caes, and Liv.
Others read ‘proximi (or proximo ')
Magnetes. ²

Magnetes. Magnesia near the
Maeander is meant, as di tinet from
Magnesia‘ a Sipylo’ (2. 47, 4), with
which Pausanias (1. 20, 5) appears to
confound it. It lay a little north of the
Maeander on a tributary stream on the
site of Inekbazar.. It appears from 4. 5 ο
3 to have become an insignificant town.

4. Antiocho. . .Mithr.idate. This
city, with Tralles and Ephesus, took the
lead in joining the Romans after the

⁴ defeat of Antiochus in 564, Β. c. 190
(Liv. 37. 45, 1), and was the only city
in Asia which held out for Rome

Χ against Mithridates in 666, B c. 88 (Id.

Ep 1¹:213ss. For the use of the plural
here and in ‘decorav'ere Drager com

⁶ leucophine:’ the form here adopted by
Halm vand Nipp. firom Lips. is supported

by coins (Mionnet‚ iii. 146, etc.). The

form‘ Leucophryenae’ (Beroald. etc.)ap-
pears to have equal support from inscrip-
tions <C.1. G. 2914 a, etc.), aud from
Strabo (14. 1, 40, 647) and Pausanias «
(3. 18, 9). The temple was named from
Leucophrys, an older town on the site of .
Magnesia; and is described by Strabo
(1.1.). as remarkable among all temples in
Asia for its symmetry and beauty, and as ‘
in size surpassed only by those at Ephesus ¹
and Didymi. Remains of it still exist. ⁷
6. Aphrodisienses, Aphrodisias, in ἑ

Caria (Pl. Ν. H. 5. 28, 29, 104), or Phrygia ἐ
