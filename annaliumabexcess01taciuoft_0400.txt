Twelve Tables will be found in Arnold,
Hist. vol. i. c. 14. In its general cha-
racter, this, like the early codes of other
nations, was probably a natural con-
sequence of the diffusion of the art of
writing, leading to a demand for such
engraved tablets, published and accessible
to all, in place of customary law, known
only to privileged exponents. It was thus
more probably grounded on existing
usages than an eclectic code (⁶ accitis quae
usquam egregia ⁷) ; but some evidence for

’ the tradition that its framers had studied

contemporary Greek models may be found
in its arrangement, apparently more sys-
tematic than that of other early codes:
see Maine, Anc. Law, ch. i. esp. pp.

Ἰ ing sentence, stating that the Subsequent

course of legislation, except such as was
directed to the repression of crime, aimed
at personal or party objects, rather than
the welsare of the whole state. It is easy
to point to laws which cannot be justly
so described; and Tagitus may have
really-meant no more than that the
enactment of this code was the last
occasion on which all orders had united
in a comprehensive attempt at legislation.
He appears to know nothing of the dis·
tinction implied in the narrative of Livy
and asserted by Cicero (de Rep. 2. 37,
63), that the two last Tables were ‘ini-

and also by Livy, who calls the first ten
Tables ‘fons omnis publici privatique
iuris’ (3. 34, 7). The division of periods
is here obscure3 for the conflict of pa-
trieians and plebeians (cp. ‘dissensione
ordinum et apiscendi illicitos honores‘)
belongs to the century immediately suc-
ceeding the decemvirate, while some of
the remarks on the ⁶ secutae leges ’ appear
to refer to later dates than even that of
the Gracchi, and ‘ alia prava’ might have
very wide reference.

in maleficos. This might refer to
old laws ‘de ambitu;’ to the ‘lex Fabia
de plagiariis' in 571, 13.c. 1833 the ‘lex
Calpurnia de repetundis’ in 605, Β. C.
149 (omitting later laws).

arose:’ cp. ‘ex re’ (1. 24, ι), etc.
dissensione ordinum, causal abt:

cp. c. 26, z, and references there. The ”

‘lex Canuleia de connubio ordinnm’
would be an instance, as also those open-
ing the magistracies; the words ‘ et
apiscendi,' etc. being explanatory of,
rather than distinct from, ‘dissensione
ordinum.'

3. apiscendi inlicitos honores. This
construction, so frequent with the gerun-
dive (Introd. v. ξ 37 d), is rare with the
gerund. The laws referred to are those

him even to sympathise with the struggle
of the patriciate against the plebeian
houses. Livy also at times speaks of the
old plebeians as if they were a rabble

pellendi claros viros. The known
instances of such banishment by special
decree or privilegium belong to later
date, and are more distinctly alluded to
below; but the words may contain a
loose and inaccurate reference to such
cases as the banishment of Camillus, the
retirement of Scipio Africanus, the ‘re-
pulsa' of Aemilius Paullus, the popular -
attacks on Scipio Aemilianus, together
with more appropriate instances, such as
the exile os Metellus N umidicus, nearer to
the time of Sulla.

4. hinc, ‘hence ensued.’ This marks a
new period, but one which was the out-
come of previous party conflicts. In
reality a long lull had succeeded the
equalisation of the orders, until the rise
of new grievances demanding redress,
which are here persistently ignored.

Gracchi et Saturnini. It is natu·
ral to suppose both the Gracchi to be
spoken of, but the rhetorical plural
‘ Saturnini' (ep. 1. 10, 3) would suggest
that ‘Gracchi’ also is to be similarly
taken, and Gaius Gracchus alone in·
tended. On the persons and their policy,
see Mommsen, Hist. Β. iv. c. 2, 3, 6.
The injustice to Gracchus of thus ranking
him on an equality with one morally and
intellectually so inferior to him as Satur-
