CORNELII TACITI ANNALJUM [A.U.C. 77ορ

ducum in aequo3 set Maroboduum regis nomen invisum apud
populares, Arminium pro libertate bellantem favor habebat.

45. Igitur non modo Cherusci sociique eorum, vetusgArminiil
miles, sumpsere bellum, sed e regno etiam Marobodui Suebae
gentes, Semnones ac Langobardi, defecere ad eum. Jquibus ad- 2

coin, the brothers are styled νέοι θεοὶ
φιλάδελφοι (Eekh. vi. 211). ‘Inconcus-
sus' appears to originate with Sen. and
Luc.

1. Illyricum. This must here be
taken to include the frontier province of
Pannonia (cp. 1. 16, 1 ; 46, 1, ete.), prob-

›ablyalso Rhaetia and Noricum (c. 63,

1). Drusus would appear to have been
sent with ‘imperium maius‚’ and there-
fore, like Germanicus, to have had ‘im-
perium proconsulare: ’ see note on 3. 19,
4. Moesia may also have been within
the terms, but must have been outside the
practical scope of his commission.
, suesceret, with dat. as 1. 31, 4, etc.

3. luxu. This trait in him is noted in
ὃ· 37, 3· ,

seque tutiorem rebatur. This
thought would qualify‚ without wholly
removing. his suspicions of Germanicus.
See Introd. viii. p. 120.

4. S6uebi. On this people, see note on
1. .

ἔμω vacui. The conj. might be
taken, with Walther‚ as explanatory, or,
with Nipp., as implying that not only
were the Romans gone, but that the
Germans were free from all sear of any
foreigner; and ‘discessu' might be, like
‘visu’ (3. 14, 3), an abl. of circumstance,
closely akin to an abl. absol. But there
is much ground for treating ‘ac,’ with
Orelli, as an error arising from the first
syllable of ⁶ vacui?

gentis adsuetudine: see note on
c. 26, ³3.

8. Maroboduum. Theposition‚power,
and character of this prince are noticed
below (c. 63), and more sully described in
Vell.·2. 108, 1093 where he is shown to
have consolidated under a royal title (cp.

fl
¹ regis nomen’ here) in Bohemia. the
most powerful combination that had yet
been seen among the Germans, with a
standing force of 70‚000 foot and 4000
horse, in alarming proximity to the Ro-
man frontier.

9. habebat. Dr'ager appears rightly
to explain this harsh zeugma by resolving
the verb in the first clause, into ‘ reddebat,
and in the last, into ‘ sequebatur? Nipp.
takes it, in the second clause, to mean
¹ held him to be a champion of sreedom,'
supposing the historian to imply (see c.
88, 3) that he was not really so, But
this explanation seems to make the -
ma still harsher, and the word wholly
ambiguous. ’

11. sumpsere bellum. This expres· ⁷

sion, frequent in Sall. and Liv., a pars

to be taken from Greek: cp. π λεμον ,

ἤραντο Thuc. 3. 39, 3.

12. Semnones. These lived beyond ἕ
the Elbe (Vell. 2. 106, 2), between that Γ

river and the Oder; and were reached by

Tiberius in 758, A.D. 5, and made terms ς,
with Rome (Mon. Auc. v. 17; Vell. 1.1.).
Strabo (7. 1, 3, 290) notes them as a. ἐ
Suebic race and subject to Maroboduus. s
In G. 39, 4, they are stated to be nume· ³

rheatuy the most important subdivision of ’ἶ
t a race. ’

Langobardi. This famous people,

‘gens etiam Germana feritate ferocior· ς

(Vell. l. 1.), are first heard of on the south

side of the Lower Elbe, next to the
Chauci; and are thought to have been ·
among those driven across that river, prob- ’

ably by Tiberius (Suet. Aug. 21). Strabo
(l. l.) calls them Λαγκόβαρδοι, and places ,
them beyond the-Elbe. In the time of ..
Tacitus they were distinguished, though ³³
not numerous (G. 40, 1). ’
