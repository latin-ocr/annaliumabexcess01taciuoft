Nora—The material of thia portion is almost wholly derived from Mommsen'a
⁵. ‘nanis-:hes Staatsrechtss vol. ii. part ²3 partly also from hia commentary on the
J ‘Har-mor Ancynnm’

³ Tu constitution of the principate is dated most properly from the

⁴ acts of Jan 13, 727, n.c. 27, and from enactments in the preceding

year ; but account must be taken both of powers held by the first

- ‘princeps' before that date, and of those which he subsequently acquired.

't Gaius Caesar Octavianus, in his nineteenth year, had raised forces on

J his own authority¹; and his position was legalised by a decree of the

⁵ aenate ofJan. 17, ¹1¹¹» nc. 43, by which he acquired the rank of pro- 's

’ praetor, with a military irnperium¹ which during the reat of his long

¹ life never lest him; ao that his ‘dies accepti imperii' is either reckoned

ζ from thia, or from the consulship, which on the 19th of August in the

name year followed it ⁸.

ζ His permanent imperium, however, during thece years comes through

³ theirregulns and mainly usur-ped powers of the triumviratu a plebiscite

³ having been hurried through the comitia in November ofthe same year

by the tribum P. Titius, creating ‘ triumviri reipublicae constituendae:

with consular power, for five years‘3 at the end of which they assumed

j another five years of power by their own act, without any formal vote ⁸.

Atmeearlydaoeduringthis periodCaesarhadassumed a title ,

. of permanent importance, the ‘praenomen imperatoris⁸.' Suetonius V
ancn‘bes this praenomen to the dictator⁷; who, however, appears from

ᾗ inscriptions to have borne the title immediately aster his family name,

, before hia title· of office ⁸. It ia suggested that the title, in thia position,

ξ became a kind of additional cognomen, auch aa his heir might adopt;

J, and thu, in usage. he might be styled indifferently ⁴ Caesar imperator'

ξ or ‘Imperator Caesar: aa men might epeak of ⁸ Aemilius Paullus· or

Ξ ‘Paullus Aemilius ⁸! However this may be, thia praenomen is hence-
