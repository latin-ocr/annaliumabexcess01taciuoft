252 CORNELII TACITI ANNALIUM [A.U.C. 768.

nuerit spectaculo ipse, varie trahebant ; alii taedio coetus, quidam

tristitia ingenii et metu conparationis, quia Augustus comiter

interfuisset. non crediderim ad ostentandam saevitiam moven-'I

dasque populi offensiones concessam filio materiem, quamquam

77. At theatri licentia, proximo priore anno coepta, graviusl
tum erupit, occisis non modo e plebe set militibus et centurione,
vulnerato tribuno praetoriae cohortis, dum probra in magistratus
et dissensionem vulgi prohibent. actum de ea seditione apud 2

10 patres dicebanturque sententiae, ut praetoribus ius virgarum in
histriones esset. intercessit Haterius Agrippa tribunus plebeis
increpitusque est Asinii Galli oratione, silente Tiberio, qui ea
simulacra libertatis senatui praebebat. valuit tamen intercessio, 4
quia divus Augustus immunes* verberum histriones quondam

¹5 responderat, neque fas Tiberio infringere dicta eius. de modo5

have the force of ‘etiarn ε’ ‘ which even
his father was said to have censmed, as
alarming to the people’ (the ‘vilis san-
guis’ of Rome).

{bagnum-it. On the tense, see on
C. 1, .

1. varie trahebant. On this sense of
‘trahere,' cp. c. 62, 3.

alii . . . quidam, ‘abstinuisse dice-
bant’ is to be supplied.

⁷²· tristitia. On his character, and
the contrast in this respect with Augustus,
see c. 54, 4, Suet. Aug. 45; Introd. viii.
p.117, etc.

3. non crediderim, etc. On the re-
jection of scandals by Tacitus, and on his
reference to tradition as an authority for
motives‚ see Introd iv. p. 24, 26.

6. proximo priore anno: see c. 54, 3.
‘Proximo’ could have well stood alone,
as in c. 22, 1 ; 78. 3. etc.; but ‘ proximus
superior’ and ‘inferior’ are used with
apparently equal redundancy by Cicero
(Orat. 64, 116; de N. D. 2. κο, 52).

7. occisis,aoristic perfect; cp Introd.
v. ξ 54 b.

set. The MS. has ‘et‚’ which, as
closely followed by another ⁸ et,’ can
hardly stand. ‘Set is suggested by the
marginal ‘sed,' and can stand without
‘etiam' as e. 60, 1. Nipp. and Pfitzner
read ‘etiam,' which, followed by ‘militi-
bus,’ could have been easily corrupted
into ‘ et,' and is used thus without ‘sed ’
in 4. 35, 1, where similar stress is laid on
the second clause.

8. praetoriae cohortis. One of these

cohorts was usually present, and an at-
tempt afterwards to dispense with it only
resulted in riot: see 13. 24, ι ; 25, 4.

11. intercessit. On the position of

tribunes, and permissive exercise of their
veto at this time, see Introd. vi. p. 76.
Haterius Agrippa. He is mentioned
as a relation of Germanicus and as
praetor (2. 51, 2, where see note), as eon-

sul (3. 49, 43 52, 1), and as a man of

profligate character (6. 4, 5).

13. simulacra: cp. ‘ durat simulacrum'
6. 1 1, 2. A similar dispute between prae-
tor and tribune is called ‘imago reipub-
licae’ in 13. 28, 1. Cp. ‘imago' liberta-
tis ’ c. 81, 4; ‘antiquitatis ’ 3. 60, 1.

14. immunes verberum. Augustus
appears from Suetonius (Aug. 45) to have

allowed the magistrates some power of

chastising actors (⁶ coercitio') at the actual
tIme and place (‘ ludis et scena’); and to
have himself ordered some to be scourged

(see on c. 54, 3). But this resolution ap- ·.
pears to have contemplated the restora- ³¹
tion of the general power as existing .

‘ omni loco et tempore, lege vetere ' (Suet.

l. 1.). See Marquardt, Staatsv. iii. p. 518. j

ΤῘιε penalty substituted seems usually to

be banishment from Italy (4. 14, 45 13. ’

25, 4); which had also been inflicted ἐ

under Augustus z see Suet. L l.

15. neque fas, etc. This obligationis
stated, prosessedly in his own word& 4.
37, 4. Cp. Agr. 13, 3 (‘eonsilium id Au· ὲ

gustus vocabat, Tiberius praeceptum’);

and Introd. viii. p. 135.
de modo lucaris. These words,
