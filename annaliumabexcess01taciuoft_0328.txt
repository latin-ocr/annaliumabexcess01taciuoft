habiti, ‘were considered to be next
in suffering and treated as next in their
relief.' The zeugma may be compared
with that in c. 44, 3.

1. Temnios, etc. These are mostly

7. in publicum. This depends on
¹ magnificam, ’ and is similarly used with
‘exitiosi ’ and ‘laetum' (11. 17, 4; 12. 3,
3); cp. ‘laeta in rempublieam’ 11. 25,
43 and note on 1. 76, 53 also ‘petita in
fiscum ' here.

small cities. Temnos Aegeae, Myrina,
and Cyme, had formed part of the old
Aeolic confederation (Hdt. 1. 149, 1) ;
the remainder are in Lydia: of these
Philadelphia alone is well knoxm, and
stoold on the site now occupied by Al-
lasc er.

2- aut Macedones Hyrcani ; so called
also in Pl. N. H. 5. 29. 31, 120. This
town, inhabited by an older race of Hyr-
cano-Persians, who had given their name
to the ‘ Hyrcanian plain' (Strab. 13. 4, 13,
629), mixed with Macedonian settlers, is
not the same with, though near to, Mos-
teni. The use of ‘ aut' might no doubt
beexplained as in the sentence a few lines
above, but the word is at least misleading.
Nipp., with F reinsh„ reads ‘et qui.’ The
change from names of people to those of
places is merely for the sake os variety:
cp. c. 60, 4, etc.

4. refoveret; a word chiefly post-Au-
gustan, frequentin Tacitus, as e. 54, 2, etc.

5. Ateius. This‘name is adopted by

Halm and Nipp., from Mommsen, and

, ⁴ Aietius ‘ by Orelli, for the MS. ‘ Aletus,’

which is no Roman name. We find from
Dio (57. 17, d7) that he had the five fasces
which woul mark his position as tem-
porarily that of a ‘legatus Augusti pro-
praetore:' see Mommsen, Staatsr. ii.

8. liberalitate: see note on c. 37, 2.

Aemiliae Musae. Doed. notes that
she was probably a freed-woman (as
Antonius Musa the physician ofAugnstus
a pears to have been a freedmanj, and
t at„ the family of her patronus was not
clearly traceable, whence her property
was claimed as an escheat, by the ‘pro-
curatores hereditatum ’ appointed for that
purpose (see Orelli‘s note). The use of

ιο. Patulei. This name, or ‘Pantu-
leius‚’ is found with the cognomen ‘Parra '
in Varr. R. R. 3, 5, and with that of ‘Grap-
tiaeus ' and ‘Anatellon ’ in later inscrip-
tions (Grut. 126, 895; C. I. L. iii. π,
6121). Nipp. It is possible that a prae·
nomen is lost, as Tacitus generally, in a
single mention of persons of rank, gives
more than one name.

11. in parte, ‘ to half the property!
Later, such legacies to the princeps were
frequently given to save the rest (cp. 14.
31, 1; 16. 11, 2; Agr. 43, 4; Plin. Pan.
43), apd even insisted on (cp. Suet. Cal.
