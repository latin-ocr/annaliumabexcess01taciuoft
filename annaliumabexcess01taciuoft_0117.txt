οἰ provinces, consisting os those in which little or no military soree was

stationed, had no higher officer than the ‘ procurator Augusti: who
appears as a subordinate officer in greater provinces. To this class
belong at this time ¹ : 1. Alpes Maritimae 3 2. Rhaetia3 3. Vindelicia ’ς
4. Noricum 3 5. Judaea (when not under native princes) ³. The procurator
osJudaea was certainly responsible to the legatus of Syria ⁴, and probably
allsuch governors were subordinated to their nearest ⁴ legati.' An excep-
tion to all these classes is the position os Egypt, where Caesar represented
the king and bad an equestrian ‘ praefectus ¹ as vicegerent ⁶.

The governors appointed by Caesar held office during pleasure and
for no fixed term ⁸, though a period os from three to five years seems
usual'. Tiberius is especially noted sor continuing them in office during

’ᾗ periods os indefinite length⁸5 as may be illustrated from such lists as
ξ can be made os the governors of important provinces during this period.

 

In Syria we find only the following · :—

r. Q. Caecilius Metellus Creticus Silanus, cos. 760, ΑΛ). 7; legatus
Syriae from at least 763-4, Α. n. 10-1 1 ¹⁰, to 770, Λ. n. 17 ¹¹.

a. Cn. Calgumius Piso, cos. 747, ac. 7 ; legatus 770-772, ΑΛ).
r -r .

3. L. {eliis Lamia, cos. 756, Α. n. 33 leg. Syr. for many years end-
ing in 785, Α. n. 3² ¹⁸, and possibly even the next successor to

pinon.
4. L. Pomponius Flaccus, cos. 770, Α. n. ¹73 leg. Syr. 785-786, Α. n.
2— ¹⁸.
