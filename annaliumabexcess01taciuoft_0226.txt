quarn invidia in Treveros: orant obsistunt, rediret maneret,

c. 42, 4), and, though ‘triste ' may have
a substantival soree (as ‘triste . . . evenit’
15. 34, 1 ; ‘triste lupus stabulis’ Verg. Ecl.
3, 80), the addition of ‘tarn’ supports
the conjecture (see Halm, Comm. Crit.),
that ‘ spectaculum,’ answering to ‘sonuS,’
may have dropped out.

3. ad Treveros [et] externae fidei.
If we are to follow most commentators
in taking the last words as a concise
{532225222533315054 ἔξῖζὲἓ· aar&
‘TreverOS,’ without a needless and even
misleading conjunctiora. ‘Et' appears also
redundant before ‘externae‘ in H. 5. 10,
3. But the force of such an expression
here (as of ‘externa superbia' in 15. 3¹,
2), should be ‘homines talis fidei, qualis
3533, ’effi‘ffirssssssatissffi‘ivssisst ‘1525333
to no other objection, seems to misrepre-
sent the thought of the speakers, which is
not one of anxiety for Agrippina’s safety,
but of sels-reproach, that the fidelity of
foreigners should be the refuge of a
Roman general’s wife against a Roman
army. The alternative explanation, tak-
ing ‘externae fidei‘ as a dative adapted
in construction to the idea of some such
verb as ‘committi,' supplied by zeugma
from ‘pergere,' is hardly justified even by
the boldness with which Tacitus uses this
figure (see Introd. v. ξ 83). Some cor·
ruption is therefore to be suspected3
though the emendations ‘externam fidem ’
(ΝΕ), or ‘externae tradi fidei’ (see
H , Comm. Crit.)‚.have hardly won
,general acceptance. On the Treveri, see
3. 40, 1, etc. ,

4. socer Drusus, etc. All these
clauses express the thoughts influencing
*the soldiers, and lead up to ⁸ sed nihil,
etc. The passage begins regularly, but
abruptly passes from ‘patris . . . memoria’

to a pregnant construction, in which men· . .

tion of the object of thought implies the
thought itself. For a similar transition,

cp. ‘cum . . . ad memoriam coniugii et
infantiam liberorum revolveretur‘ (1 1. 34.
1). Wolf remarks that here the change
seems designedly introduced, as if to de-
note that not merely the recollection, but
the image itself of Drusus, their former
beloved commander, is as vividly before
them as those whom they actually saw.
The relationship expressed is throughout
that of Agrippina.

5. insigni fecunditate. of the nine
children whom she had in all, three were
now living, and six had been born. See
Introd. ix.

in castris genitus. Gaius was
fflmffihsswssogsst‘? ιζ’ἕὲὲε ἓῖωκξηξξέἓ
in an epigram quoted by Suetonius (Cal.
8), ‘In castris natus‚' etc. But he was
born when his father, as consul, was in
Rome; and Suetonius (l. l.) shows, from
a letter of Augustus, that the child was
in Italy not long after the date of birth3
and that the birthplace was stated in the
‘ acta publica ’ to have been Antium.

6. militari vocabulo: see on c. 23. 4.

7. ad concilianda vulgi studia. The

‘caliga’ was not worn by officers above

the rank of centurion, and is tbus so far
characteristic of the common soldier, that
‘ caligatus' is used sor ‘ miles gregarius ’
(Suet. Aug. 253 Vit. 7), and ‘in caliga,‘
or ‘a caliga' sor ‘in‚' or ‘from the ranks’
(Pl. N. H. 7. 42, 44, 1353 Seu. de Benef.
5. 16, 2). Hence it is called ‘habitus
gregalis’ (c. 69, 5), or ‘manipularius'
(Suet. Cal. 9).

8. aeque quam: ep. 14. 38, 3, ete.
In prose from Livy, who appears to take

it from Plautus.

9. orant obsistunt. etc. The con-
struction is again designedly abrupt:
‘ orant' is explained by ·rediret,’ ‘ma-
neret ; ' ‘obsistunt‘ refers strictly to ‘pars
. occursantes,' and more loosely to

‘plurimi . . . regressi.’
