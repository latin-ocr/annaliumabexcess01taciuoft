childbirth3 Dio (59. 8, 7), apparently in
error, that Gaius divorced her to marry
Cornelia Orestilla.

1. imitando amorem. This, the MS
text, was needlessly altered in the old
editions to ‘ amore3' some also adopted
the marginal correction ‘immittendoz ¹
cp. ‘quamquam maestitiam imitarentur'

1. 2 .
pss'ciloque . . . vincire: cp. ‘ani-
mum . . . vinxisse' 4. 10, 2. This in-

trigue is also represented by Dio (58. 28,
4) as contrived by Macro; by Philo (Leg.
ad Gai. 6) as the work of Ennia alone;
by Suet. (Cal. ιο) as originated by Gaius
himself. Ennia and Macro were both
forced to commit suicide in 791, A. D. 38
(Dio, 59. 10, 6).

2. dominationis apisceretur. This
verb is nowhere else used with genit.:
cp. the similar construction with ‘adipi-
sci’ (3- 55, 1)- ,

3. commotus, ‘passmnate ' (see on 1.
33, 6). It does not, like ‘turbidus animi ’
(H. 4. 48, 2), or ‘ Gai turbata mens’ (13.
3, 6), denote his insanity, which was a
later development.

simulationum falsa, a strong in-
stance of the absence of any partitive
meaning in a genit. of this kind (Introd.
v ὁ 32)-

5. hoo, the whole state of things men-
tioned above.

dubitavit, etc.‚ ‘he hesitated whom
to designate as successor.’ On the means
of indirect nomination in this respect open
to the princeps, see Introd. vi p. 82;
Mommsen, Staatsr. ii p. 1080 foll.

6. nepotes. Tiberius Gemellus, the
son of Drusus, was in his eighteenth³ year

(2. 84,1)‚ but had not taken the‘ toga
virilis' (Suet. Cal 15.) Gaius wasinhis
twenty· -fifth year (Suet. Cal. 8).

8. vulgi studia: see 1. 41. 3: on the
popularity of the house os Germanicus in
general, see 3. 29, 3; 5. 4. 3, etc.

9. agitanti: so ‘agitare de aliqua ιε’
11. 23, 1; 15 5ο, 4, etc. In earlier writ-
ers ‘agitares in this sense, has usually ι
word such as ‘animo ’.added

conposita aetate: so again in 13.
1, 2. The expression appeais to answer
to the καθεστηκυῖα ἡλικία of Thuc. 2. 36,
4, and to the‘ constans aetas quae media
dicitur' of Cic. de Sen 20, 76 Claudius
was now in his sorty-sixth year (Suet. Cl.
2)

bonarum artium cupiens. For the
gen. with‘ cupiens? cp. 1. 75, 4· for this
use of‘ artes,’ cp c. 7, 1; 4.6, 2, etc.
This taste of Claudius for literary culture
is spoken os ιιι 13. 3, 1, etc. Suet. (Cl.
3) says ‘disciplinis liberalibus ab aetate
prima non mediocrem operam dedit: and
gives further account (c 41, 4²) οἱ his
historical and other compositions.

10. inminuta mens ‘imbecility; 'so
used of a mind enfeebled by diseyase in
Sall. Jug.65, 1: compare the expressions
cited on c. 45, 6, sor the insanity ofGaius.
On the mental weakness os Claudius, see
3.18,;7 ιι. 28,2; ι2.,;.33671;
Suet. Cl. -2-5, etc.

13. praesentium. Ni 1pp. takes this as
a neuter, such neuters being often used by
Tacitus in other cases besides the nom.
and acc. (see his note on 3. 1⁵³, 6). It
seems however here to be better taken as
masc. answering to ‘in posteros.’

in posteros ambitio : cp. ‘gloria
