8. Marcum Lepidum. The praeno-
men οἱ this person is here alone given in
full, the praenomen ‘Manius’ in full in
c. 22, 2. The Fasti give M. Lepidus as
consulin 759, A. D. 63 M'. Lepidus in 764,
A. D. 11. Elsewhere in this MS. the
praenomen of Lepidus is constantly read
as M.; but two distinct persons are thus
named. The one is sent this year to
Asia, the other is one os the two selected
for Africa (c. 35, 1), and becomes pro-
consul οἱ Asia five years later (4. 56, 3).
One is of moderate ability and narrow
means (as here and e. 72, 33 2. 48, 1),
the other one of the foremost men of the
age (1. 13, 2, etc). As the Fasti recog-
nise as consulars of this time not two
Marci Lepidi, but Marcus and Manius,
the praenomen in the MS. must in some
places be altered. 1t appears on the
whole best to suppose the one mentioned
here and in c. 72, 3; 2. 48, 1, clearly
also in 6. 40, 4, to be Marcus; and that
Manius Lepidus is the distinguished sena-
tor (1. 13, 2), praised alike for his inde-
pendence and discretion (4. 20, 43 6. 27,
4), the defendet os Cn. Piso (c. 11, 2)
and his sister Lepida (c. 22, 2), who in·

terposed on behals of Clutorius Priscus ’

(c. 50, 1), was considered capable of ser-
vice in Africa (c. 3 5, 1), and subsequently
govemed Asia (4. 56, 3). Consequently
in all these places M. has been altered to
Μ’. Ritter, who had formerly taken a
different view, now follows this reading.

etiam Asiae sorte, i. e. even from the
lot for a peacesul province. Asia and
Africa were given annually by lot to the
two senior consulars who had not yet held
either. As AfrIca was now to be given
‘extra sortem‚' there were really no lots
to be drawn, and Lepidus would have
