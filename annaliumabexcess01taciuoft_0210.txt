Lipsius in this emendation of the MS.

often results in Tacitus from an apparent
desire to improve the sound os the sen-
tence; and the eclipse, though itself
graduaL may have suddenly attracted
notice. Orelli follows Weissenborn in
reading ‘claro plena,' supposing a re-

languescere. This word is no-
where else used of an eclipse. but Pliny
(N. H. 27. 13, 109, 133) uses it of paling
colour, ‘color in -luteum languescens.'
This eclipse is fixed by astronomical
calculation to Sept. 26, 3 to 7 a. m., and
thus determines the chronology of these
events. See note on c. 16, 1.

rationis ignarus. Mr. Dallin has
noted the proof here given of the igno·
rauce at this time of the legionary soldier
(not the lowest class of Roman society),
respecting the scientific explanation of
eclipses, a truth well known to educated
Romans as early as Lucretius (5, 751.
etc.) and Cicero (de Divin. 2. 6, 17), and,
if the story of C. Sulpicius Gallus (Liv.
44. 37) be true, even as early as 13.c. 168
(see also Cic. de Rep., 1. l.). A similar
contrast is shown by the ignorance of the
Athenian army, and even of Nicias (Thuc.
7. 50, 4), of the scientific theory which
had been laid down, though in the face of
much prqiudice, by Anaxagoras (Plut.
Nicias, c. 23), and which, from the
account of Herodotusu. 74, 3), was
known even to Thales. We may notice
that even Vergil (G. 2, 475) speaks in
‘lang-uage adapted to popular superstition
(‘ Defectus solis van‘os lunaeque labores ’) ;
and that this idea of a conflict with en·
chantment‚ in which the moon was to be
aided by the din of metal, though deplored
as a superstition by Pliny (see below),
was not only n'fe in the time of Juvenal

(Sat. 6. 442), but even, as Lipsius notes,
was a belief among Christians in the
time of Maximus Taurinensis (Α. D. 450).

2. suis. Most editors have followed
F reinsheim in this reading. The MS.has
¹ asuis‚’ the margin ‘ ac suis.' The latter
is accepted by Walther‚who considers that
‘ac ’ joins ‘adsimulans’ to ‘ ignarus3’
but we can hardly suppose that Tacitus
would have put such a clause after
‘ accepit.’ Pfitzner (p. 61) conjectures
that ‘ asuis ' may represent ‘ assiduis’ (cp.
‘tentes ' c. 17. 4) ; which is supported by

‘ aeteruum laborem ' below; but we ap5

pear here to require the pronoun to show
to what ‘labores ’ those of the moon are
compared.

reading ‘qua’ sor ‘quae‚’ but appears
rightly to think the further alteration of
‘cessura’ to ‘ cessurum’ needless. The
sentence is equivalent to ‘ resque prospere
cessuras. ea via qua pergerent,’ ⁴ that the
course on which they were advancing
(that of mutiny) would succeed.' The
MS. ‘quae‚' which is retained by Orelli.
might be taken as a quasi-cognate accusa-
tive, analogons to ‘ pergere iter‚' etc.‚bnt
has no direct parallel. In any interpreta-
tion, the sense os such a participle as
‘putans' has to be supplied from ‘ ad-
simulans!

4. claritudo: see note on c. 43, 3.

aeris sono . . . strepere. An ex·
planation of this practice may be gathered
from Pliny (N. H. 2. 12, ο, 54) ‘misera
hominum mente in defectibus scelera aut
mortem aliquam siderum pavente . . . at
in luna veneficia arguente mortalitate et
ob id crepitu dissono auxihante? For'
other allusions to it, see Liv. 26. 5, and
the passages referred to in the note
above.

5. prout splendidior obscuriorve.
If the sky was still clear of cloud (as
would seem from the next sentence), and
the mere progress of the eclipse is meant,
Tacitus would appear to be describ-
ing not the real phenomena, but the
sancies of the soldiers. lt is however
possible that he may mean to describe
