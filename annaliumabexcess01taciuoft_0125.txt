:² their titles are given in a multitude of inscriptions ⁸, and their total
strength is estimated by Tacitus as being much the same in the aggregate
ss that of the legions ⁴. Commanded by separate officers ³, such forces,

’ others srmed and disciplined like the legions themselves ⁸. Other such
forces were more looelly distributed ⁰, and surnished protection where no

those of the legions; the urban are known by their numbers only ¹¹.
