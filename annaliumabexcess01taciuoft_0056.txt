38 INTRODUCTION.

Quintilian 1. 5, 38) in the case of Latinized Greek names in ‘-us’ (cp.
ξ 10 ; and Nipp on 2. 69, 1), is used more sreely by Tacitus than by
any other writer3 e. g. Armenia 1. 3, 3 3 Etruria Lucania et omni Italia
11. 24, 23 Suria 13. 35, 2, etc. A similar abl. of common names is
used, without the ordinary restrictiori to domo, rure, humo (Madv. 275),
as suga impediverat 1. 39, 6; progrediuntur contuberniis 1. 41, 2, etc.;
often by exerting the force of a prep. in composition, as in the extension
of the usual phrase abire magistratu to abire'sedibus 2. 19, 2 3 and in the
abl. with abhorrere 1. 54, 33 effundere 2. 23, 2; emergere 1. 65, 23

eruere 2. 69, 5; extrahere 1. 39, 4, ete. Analogous is the abl. with
recens 1. 41, 5, etc. Dr. § 56.

25. 'I'he ablativo of place at which (Roby 1170) is used with the
same freedom as in poetry (Id. 1173, Madv. 273, Obs. 2, Kennedy 155,
2), whether as expressing direction, in a quasi-instrumental sense analo-
gous to ‘via,' as porta triumphali 1. 8, 4 ; finibus Frisiorum 1. 60, 2;
litore Oceani 1. 63, 5 ; or, much oftener, position, as structis molibus
2. 60, 4; toro 3. 5, 63 saxis et aere 4. 43, 23 campo aut litore 4. 74. 6,
etc.;* also with neut. adjectives, as medio 2. 52, 6, etc.; plano H. 3. 19, 33
vicino Id. 38, 2, etc. often with a genit. following. Dr. § 57. Many in-
stan'ces are collected by Nipp. on 1. 60; 2. 52 ; 3. 61.

, 26. 'Phe ablativo of time throughout which, almost wholly post-

Augustan (Roby 1184, 1185), is found not only in such expressions as
quatuordecim annis 1. 53, 6 (Cic.); but also such as triumviratu 3.
28, 33 bellis civilibus 6. 11, 33 triumphis, votis 15. 45, 2. On the other
hand, Tacitus often uses ‘ in' to express time when, or in the course of
which (Roby 1180, 1182), as tali in tempore 2. 84, 3 ; eo in ternpore
11. 29, 1, ete„ whence later authors (as Laet.) even say ‘in hieme,’ ‘in
aestate! Dr. ξ 58, Zumpt 596.

27. The extension of the instrumenta} ablativo to personal agentS,
though poetical in its free use, is not without classical precedents, as
centurione comitatus (Cic.) 14. 8, 5, cp. legionibus petitum 2. 46, 23
corruptoribus tentare 2. 79, 4; Artabano perculsus 6. 44, 33 and other
instances in which the personality is not prominent. See Nipp. on 2. 79 ;
6. 44. Such ablatives might often be taken as datives (see § 18). Dr.

28. 'I'he ablativo of manner is employed with unusual boldness, with·
out the addition of an adjective (Roby 1236, 1239), as spe vel dolore
1. 59, 13 clamore et impetu 1. 68, 43 ordinibus ac subsidiis 2. 80, 6;
catervis 4. 51, 15 multis millibus 6. 37, 4 3 convivio 1 3. 20, 5, etc. Some
