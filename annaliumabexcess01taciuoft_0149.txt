CHARA CTER ΛΝΒ Go VERNMENT OF TIBERI US. 131

Distinctions must be again drawn, as before. Much noble and much
innocent blood, no doubt, was shed; but much that was noble was
probably not innocent, and much was neither noble nor innocent, but
that of the creatures os Seianus, who bad staked their chauces on his
success. None need pity Latinius Latiaris ², Vescularius Flaccus ², Julius
Marinus⁸, Fulcinius Trio ⁴, or any others of the like description3 nor is
anytbing recorded even of so prominent a man as Asinius Gallus, or of
many others, which should make them deserving of special sympathy:
the suicide os Cocceius Nerva ⁸, probably also of Arruntius ⁸, ³is their
own gratuitous act. But there are circumstances os horrible cruelty in
the execution os the young children os Seianus ⁷, and os the aged mother
οῖ Fufius Geminus ⁸, and in the causes assigned for the destruction of
the descendants of Theophanes’: and even if these were all, such
cases are hardly palliated by being few.

The tales os abominable profligacy¹⁰ are more difficult to discuss or
deal with. A life prolonged without medical aid to the age os seventy-
eight may be pleaded as counter evidence ¹¹3 retirement gave abundant
scope sor fabrication of scandal ς arehives os state trials may osten
bave preserved record os mere unproved or even disproved libels, ac-
cepted in later times as facts ¹²3 nor do older writers, as Philo and

, Josephus, Seneca and the elder Pliny, show any knowledge os the
i orgies oi' Capreae. On the other hand, such testimony as we have is
definite and circumstantial, and states that latterly no concealment was
attempted ¹⁸. The history os language is also made to surnish evidence;
the age was certainly one of growing profligacy3 and the characters os
two at least os the companions of his solitude, Gaius Caesar aud Aulus
Vitellius ¹⁴, are beyond rehabilitation.

:f There are still flashes οἰ vigour, as in the blow which struck down
s Seianum and the display of energy in the East into which the taunts
,Ἰ of the Parthian king had goaded him ¹⁸. Again, is he was keen to fill
the ‘fiscus¹⁰,' he could still be munificent in the use of it, either to
restore tinancial confidence ¹⁷, or, as before, to relieve the sufferers by
a flre ¹⁸. He still organises the corn-supply of Rome ¹· ; even interests
himself in such minor matters as the authenticity os the Sibylline canon ”.
in general, however, the administration is described as sinking into
