1. veteris populi, etc. The expres-
sion is varied in 4. 32, 1, to ‘veteres
populi Romani res.’ In H. 1. 1, 1 ‘dum

wholly absent in the other places, between
national history and mere ⁴ res principum?

2. ,clamis scriptoribus. On this da-
tive, see introd. v. 5 18; and on the
gerundive dative with ‘ desuere‚’ Id. ξ 22
b. This use of ⁴ dicere‚’ though mainly
poetical, is found in Sall. (Jug. 95, 2)
and Liv. (7. 29, 1, etc.).

3. deeora ingenia, e. g. Pollio, Livy,
Q. Labienus, Cremutius Cordus, and
others. ’ Some writers of later history, as
M. Seneca and Aufidius Bassus, included
the time of Augustus in their work. See
Introd. iii. p. 11, 12.

4. deterrerentur. On the use os the
subj. of facts with ¹ donec,’ see Introd. v.
5 53. The reason here assigned may have
been that which induced Livy to conclude
his history in 745, ΒΕ. 9.

que . . . et . . . ae. Such variation
os conjunctions is often adopted for
elegance (see Introd. v. 5 89), but here,
as Nipp. suggests, is intended to combine
in pairs the two Julian and two Claudian
Caesars, as in H. 2. 76, 4.

5. taleae, ‘ falsified‚' as. ‘falsae tabu-
lae‘ (Suet. Aug. 19),- etc.

6. compositae. ‘ Componere res‘ is a
condensed expression. like ‘componere

’ Iliam tempora' Vell. 1. 3, 2, ete. On

the chief historical works which Tacitus
may have used, see Introd. iii. pp. 10—14.
7. cetera, i. e. to the death of Nero.
after which the ‘ Histories‚’ already pub-
lished‚ begin.
&quorum cauam, i. e. ‘iniuria’ or
‘ beneficium.’ The whole passage in

H. 1. 1 should be compared with this. On
the apparent belief of Tacitus in his own
impartiality, see Introd. iv. p. 22, foll.

9. caesis, used, like ‘interfecto’ be-
ῙΟΨ, with some rhetorical lioense, of sels-
inflicted deaths.

publica arma, ¹ army of the Re-
public.' It is implied that the forces of
the triumvirs‚ as well as those of Pom-
peius, were mere ‘ privata arma,’ and that
Brutus and Cassius represented the State.
On the other hand, in Mon. Ane. i. ιο,
they are represented as exiles by judicial
sentence, and as outlaws in arms against
their country.

10. Pompeius, etc. He was ‘cmshed’
(‘ oppressus‚' used thus of decisive defeat,
3. 41, 3, etc.) by Agrippa off Naffloehus,
near Pelorum, Sep. 3, 718, B.c. 36. His'
death took place in Asia in the following
year. Lepidus was at the same time
⁸ stripped of power' (‘exuto') ; his army
of twent legions being induced to desert
him, an no office left to him but that of
‘ Pontifex maximus? which he was allowed -
to retain in seclusion at Circeii till his ··
death in 742, B.c. 14. ἒ ⁷

11. Iulianis, ‘Caesarian.’ This term, .
applied to 'the troops of Julius Caesar κ
(Suet. Jul. 75), as is also ‘Caesariani’ ν
(Bell. Afr. 13, ι), is here applied astes· v
his death to the party of the triumvits3 ‘
as that of the senate or ⁵ optimatoe’ ie
still, aster the death of its leader, styled ,
‘Pompeianae partes’ (c. 10, 1). Sex.
Pompeius is regarded here as external to
both these parties. ⁴

η. posito triumviri nomine, etc.
On this whole passage, see Introd. vi. ¹
pp. 64, 65. It has been shown brt
Mommsen (Staatsr. ii. p. 772), that jra- ”
