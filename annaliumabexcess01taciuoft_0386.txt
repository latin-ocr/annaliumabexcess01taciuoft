1. discumberet. This verb is used
by post-Augustan writers of a single per·
son, but only where the presence of others
is implied: cp. 4. 54, ²3 6. 50, 5.

2. visu. This appears to be an ex-
tension of the modal ablative (see Introd.
v. 5 28) to denote an attendant circum-
stance, such as would usually be express·
ed by an abl. abs. ‘tot adstantibus et vi-
dentibus: ’ see Nipp. on 4, 51.

3. offerebat, sc. ‘in tormenta? His
own slaves could be questioned as to the
ffifflzfflg·1235}sffiffpzissngfi.{32ffi}3?.³
and who would be servants of Germani-
cus, could be examined on what had
taken place at the meal.

5. caesar. That Tiberius presided at
this trial, is shown by his putting the
question to the consul (e. 17, 8).

6. scripsissent expostulantes. Nipp.

sation and desence appear to have been
conducted according to the programme
¹ laid down in c. 13, 1. Now we hear that
the accusation was renewed and the de·
fenoe abandoned (c. 15, 4), and the trial
still prolonged after Piso's death (c. 17,
6). It is inserted that a ⁶ comperendina-
tio’ had ensued, with introduction os new
matter„ possibly some charge made by
Piso against Germanicus, which had led

to a counter-demand for the production
of some private letters. ‘ Expostulantes ’
is used asin 1. 19, 3; 12. 46, 33 ¹⁵- 17,
5, etc.

9. temperaturos manibus: cp. ‘risui
temperare ’ (13. 3, 2), etc.

10. Gemonias. Usually thus abbre-
viated, as in 5. 9, 3; 6. 25, 4, etc„ but
in full, ‘ Gemoniae scalae‚' in Val. Max.
6. 3, 3, etc. These stairs, on which the
bodies of criminals were exposed, led
from the Capitol to the Forum, near the
Mamertine prison. This destruction of
statues may be illustrated from the de·
seription of the sall of Seianus (Juv. ιο,

1 2. deductus, ‘he was escorted home.’

eustos saluti: see Introd. v. 5 19.

13. mortis exactor, ‘ exactor,' by itself, Σ

is thus used in 11. 37, 4. The sense ap·

pears to originate with Livy, who 1181

¹ exactor supplicii’ in 2. 5, 5.

15. quantum .
Caesar could venture against her: ’ 8
bitter allusion to his mother's ascendanoy
over him (see 4. 57, 4).

16. mediae, ‘ hung in the balance)

si ita. ferret. This phrase is re·
peated from H. 2. 44, 4, and appears to

occur nowhere else. It is an abbre- -
viation of such forms ,as ‘fors tulit· ζ
(Sall. Jug. 78, 2), or ‘res tulit· (Liv. 3. ‚.

27, 6).
