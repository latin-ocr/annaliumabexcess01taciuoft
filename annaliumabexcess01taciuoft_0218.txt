to be stronger than the simple verb.

8. sio melius audituros responsum,
‘ they replied that they would hear better
as they were‚' i. e. crowding round him
in a mass. This refusal is contrasted with
the reluctant obedience (⁴ tarde obtem-
peravere ’) to his next order. On this

uerat’ (6. 25, 3). Orelli less well ex-
plains it by ‘ redimebat' (‘ compensated ’).
1. pro 'I'iberio niti: cp. ‘nullo pro
Galba nitente ' H. 1. 55, 4.
seque et proximos. This is adop-
ted, after Haase, by Orelli and Halm, sor
the MS. ‘seque proximos’ (see Halm,

Comm. crit). The text of older editions,
‘Sequanos proximos,' couples a portion of
a single tribe to the whole province of
‘Gallia Belgica;' while Nipp.'s reading,
‘ Sequanos, proximas et 'would necessitate
the explanation of ‘et’ as=‘etiam' (as
‘aegro et corpore’ c. 4, 2, etc.), which
seems here without force. Germanicus
would naturally take the oath himself,
and then tender it to those next in rank
(see on c. 7, 3), such as his ⁴ amicorum
cohors;’ who might be spoken of as
‘ proximi.’

2. in verba eius. The ‘princeps‚’
though absent, is conceived as dictating
the oath of allegiance to him. This is
the first instance on record, and probably
the first actual instance, of extension of
the ‘sacramentum,’ not only (as in c. 7,
3) to civilians, but even to provineials.
A similar course is mentioned as taken in
Syria on the death of Tiberius (J os. Ant.
s 18. 5, 3). For the practice later,'see Pl.
‘⁷ ad 'grai 52. Cp. Mommsen, Staatsr. ii.

5. audiri coepere. On the use of the
infibpass. with this verb, cp. Introd. v. 5
⁴² .

exosculandi. This word is con-
snaed to writers of this age, and appears

use οἱ ‘sic,‘ cp. ‘sic quoque’ (4. 40, 43
15. 17, 3). Nipp. thinks that ‘est‚’
which occurs· with ‘ responsum ' in c. 26.
1, should be here inserted.

9. vexilla: sc. ‘manipulorum:' cp.c.
20, 1. This has been held to imply that
no ‘signa cohortium’ existed (see on c.
18, 3) ; but it is possible to suppose also
that, through some circumstances of the
tumult, the ensigns os the maniples could
more readily be got at. To bring these
to the front would infuse some order into
the mass, as the soldiers would instinc·
tively group themselves round them (see
c. 38, 4); and a kind of formation in
cohorts would result.

10. veneratione, ⁸ expressions of reve-
rence.’ The word is especially suitable
to a deified emperor, though not restricted
to such: cp. 12. 42, 3.

11. flexit. This verb is used intransi-
tively by Verg. Liv., etc. Its application
to a turn of speech (ep. 6. 15, 5; ¹3· 3,
2), or thought (cp. 4. 37, κς 41, a), ap-
pears to be T acitean.

12. illis cum legionibus. In c. 42, 6,
the first and twentieth are particularly
mentioned. On the German campaigns
of Tiberius, see Introd. viii. pp. 114, 115.

14. nil usquam, etc. This general ac-
