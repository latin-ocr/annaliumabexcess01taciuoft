CORNELII 'TACJTJ ANNALIUM [A.U.C. 7⁶9·

len with moisture;' such being the de-
scription of the country (H. 5. 14, 3 ; 17,
4), and the expression like ‘vere tument
terrae’ (Verg. G. 2, 324)- He takes
these ablatives as absol., explaining ‘ im—
menso nubium tractu,’ which contains the
cause: cp. Sen. Nat. Quaest. 5. 12, 5
‘facit ergo ventum resoluta nubes.'

2. disiecit naves: so also Liv. 30.
24, 7; from Verg. Aen. 1. 43.

3. insulas. These appear to be dis-
tinct from the distant islands of c. 24, 2,
and must be those near the mouth of the
Ems or Weser. The quicksands described
would perfeetly suit the islands bordering
on the ‘Wadden' shoals, but no rocky
island can be found nearer than Heligo-
land. The rocks appear therefore to be
the addition of romance‚ as in c. 24, 3.

4. postquam mutabat, etc. The tide
had hitherto offered some resistance to
the wind. The sentence shows reminis-
cence of Livy (26. 45, 8), ‘acer . . . Sep-
temtrio . . . inclinatum stagnum eodem
quo aestus ferebat? ‘Muto’ is intrans. in
12. 29, 1, and osten in Livy3 as is also
‘fero’in such phrases as ‘via,’ ‘res’ (cp.
3. 15, 2), ‘animus sert3' and, in Caes.
(B. G. 3. 15, 3), in the same expression as
here3 ‘quo ventus ferebat ς ’ also in Livy
1. 7, 6 ‘si . . . eo vestigia ferrent?

7. manantes . . . superui-gente.
‘Manantes’ is best taken as belonging to
both clauses. The ships are dripping‚
from Jeakage through the sides (cp. ‘laxis
laterum compagibus,’ etc. Verg. Aen. 1,
122), and from waves breaking over. ‘Su-

perurgeo ’ is otherwise unknown, and per-
haps (with Doed.) the word should be
written ‘divisim.’

9. truculentia. One os the words
which Tacitus appears to have resusci-
tated, frorn Plaut. Truc. 3. 2, 7 (see Introd.
v. § 96). The adj. however is used figu-
ratively of the sea in Catull. 63, 16⁸5 64,
1 79. ·

10. praestat . . . excessit. That which
is exceeded is supplied from the context.
So ‘excessit’ c. 33, 2, ‘praestitisset’ ο.

ιῗ. ita vasto et profundo. It seems
better to supply ‘mari ’ stom the follow·
ing ⁴ mare‚' than to alter the latter to the
former <with J. F. Gron.)‚ or (with Nipp.)
to take ‘vasto et profundo ' as having an
indefinite subject, or as substantiva.
‘Around them were shores peopled with
enemies, or (on the other side) a sea so
wide and deep that they imagined it to
be the end os the world, with no land
beyond.' On the use οξ ⁶ circum.’ cp. 4.
{321⁸.ig¹3.‘;¹.¹i{‚f0<222‘i;51113⁵1’.<2¹g¹33⁶2?
3: also Introd. v. 5 66.

13. insulas longius sitas. These are
distinct from those mentioned in c. ²3, 3,
and may probably have lain off the west
coast of Schleswig.

· 15. elisa, ⁴ ad littus eiecta.‘

x toleraverant, ‘had maintained) i.e.

up to the time of their discovery. The
verb, in this sense, has a persona! accus.
in Caes. and Plin. mai.
