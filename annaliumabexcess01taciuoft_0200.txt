signment of land substituted.

1. enimvero, used, like ἀλλὰ μήν, to
anticipate an objection, such as, that sol-
diers might save out of their pay.

2. denis in diem assibus: see below,
on ‘ singulos denarios.’

3. hino vestem, etc. The enactment
stated (Plut. C. Gracch. 5, 837) to have
been procured by Gracchus, providing
the soldier with clothing at the public
eost, must have become obsolete; while
the later enactments providing for their
arms and equipment (see Marquardt,
Staatsv. ii. p. 94) had not yet come into
force. From the absence of any allusion
to food‚ it appears that they received
rations of corn besides their pay, a pri-
vilege not granted to the praetorians till
ther time of Nero (see 15. 72, 1; Suet.
Ner. ιο).

saevitiam centurionum et vaca-
tiones munerum: both expressions de-
note the same practice. If centurions
knew that a soldier had money to spate,
they laid additional tasks on him to
make him purchase furlough or exemp-
tion. A full description of this system,
and of the demoralisation resulting from
it, is given in H. 1. 86.

4. redimi. This verb can be used,
in different senses‚ as well with ‘saevi-
tiam' as with ‘vacationes ;' having often
the meaning of ‘buying off ' what is un·
pleasant, as well as of ‘ buying’ what is
desirable. It would n'ot however be used
with equal propriety of the stoppages sor
. necessaries, such as clothes, etc. ;’ 50 that
for these the sense of the simple verb

‘emi' appears to be supplied from its
compound‚ as ‘petivere' from the follow-
ing‘ repetivere’ in 15. ιι, 2.

hercule. This points the contrast
between scanty pay and abundant hard-
ships. ¹

cem assibus datus3' which may be ex-
plained to mean that the soldiers reoeived
the same fraction of the ‘denarius' as
before. At that time their pay yis reeks
oned by Polybius (6. 39, 12) at two obols
or¹ ς of the‘ denarius’ = 5“ of the reduced
‘'asses. It would appear that subse-
quently, when the pay was nominally
doubled by Julius Caesar (Suet. Jul. 26),
it was really raised, not to 103, but only
to 10 ‘asses,' and that the account given
by Pliny is so far untrue. But they now
demand, not merely this extra fraction,
but the suu ‘deum-ius, ' alleging that the
praetorians, whose pay was, yregula-
tion, only the double of theirsb (Dio, 53.
11, 5), received actually two full‘ denarii:
= 32⁶ asses. ' For further information, see
Marquardt, Staatsv. ii. pp. 92—94. 1t has
been thought that we have here theex
aggeration of the speaker, and that the
pay of the praetorians cannot really have
been so much greater. It is certainly
observable that this grievance is through-
out less prominent than that of the de-
layed discharge (see c. 19, 4, etc.)‚ and
that the coneessions offered even in the
extreme cn'sis (c. 36, 4) contain no al-
lusion to it.

sextus decimus: the limit of the
earlier regulation of Augustus (Dio, 54.
