Ep. 122, 11. The family was old and
noble (Cic. de Div. 2. 21, 47, ete), and
several references to them are collected
by Borghesi (v. 311 ; see Nipp. here).
An inscription (Ι. R. N. 1896) mentions
one L. Pinarius L. f. Natta, who had
filled various offices and magistraeies up
to that of aedile, and who may be the
person here mentioned.

Scipio committed suicide and Afranius ⁰

uses this term of Brutus (1. 5, 7, etc.), of

Cassius (1. 8, 8), and os the conspirator-s ’

14. Pollionis scripta. According to ,

Suidas (s. v. Ἀσίνιος Πωλλίων) the history

of Pollio consisted of seventeen books. It
began from 694, B. C. 60 (Hor. Od. 2. 1, ’Ῐῗῖ

mentioning an event as late as 742, B.c.
