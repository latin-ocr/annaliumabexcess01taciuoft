CORNELII TA CI TI ANNA LI UM [A.U.C. 7⁶7.

per annos sacramentum in nomen Tiberii; -interrogatusque a
Tiberio num se mandante eam sententiam prompsisset, sponte
dixisse respondit, neque in iis quae ad rem publicam pertinerent
consilio nisi suo usurum, vel cum periculo offensionis: ea solae

species adulandi supererat.
umeris senatorum ferendum.

Messalla Corvinus, and brother of Cotta
Messalinus (2. 32, 2, ete.). He was con-
sul in 751, Β. c. 3 (Suet. Galb. 4); as
was his son in 773, Α. D. 20 (3. 2, 5),

and his grandson m 811, Α. D. 58 (13. 34,

1). He is also known as having won

‘triumphalia' in Pannonia (Vell. 2.112)‚

as a friend of Tibullus (2. 5, 17). and of
Ovid (ex P. 1. 7; 2. 2), as a speaker (3.
34. 2), and writer (Suet. Aug. 74); but as
of servile character (here, and 3. 18, 3).
Some further references to him are given
by N ipp.

renovandum, etc. This annual re-
newal of the ‘ sacramentum ’ had become
a regular custom on the first of January
by 822, Ἀ. 1). 69 (H. 1. 55, 1). We also
hear of such renewals on the anniversary
of accession (Pl. ad Trai. 52). See
Momms. Staatsr. ii. p. 768.

4. offensionis. Dr. notices that this
form is used invariably in the Annals, as
‘ offensa ’ invariably in the other works.

ea. sola speeies, etc„ i. e. this show
of independence was the only form of
flattery not stale.

6. remisit, ‘Caesar, with haughty
condescension‚ excused them,' i. e. from
the duty, as they had themselves ap·

⁴ parently ytermed it (⁶ ferendum ¹). His

arrogance may have consisted in the use

‘of‘ remitto' or some such word, implying

a right to command the service which is
thus waived. ‘Remittere' has the force
of excusing from a ’duty, as ‘remissa cura‘
(3.55, 1), ‘remisisse reipublicae novissi-
mum casum’ (H. 2. 48, 4), ‘remitto

ne. .dorsum demulceatis’ (Liv. 9. 16,

16). It does not here convey a prohibi-
ti0n; and the body was borne by senators
according to Suet. (Aug. 100); which
honour had been previousgly paid to Sulla
(App. Β. C. 1.1o6). and was here the
natural climax to the previous bearing b
‘decuriones' and by knights. See on c.g7,

7. edicto. This also would be by
virtue of his tribunitian power (see c. 7, 5).
ἓίιιιίΙαι ediets are mentioned 3. 6, 15 4.

8. funus divi Iulii. The chief au-
thorities sor the famous scene at that
funeral are Suet. Jul. 143 Plumeaae. 68 ;
Dio, 44, 36-50.

in campo Max-tis. The pile was near
the ‘Mausoleum’ built by Augustus in
726, Β. c. 28 (Suet. Aug. 100); the lower
portion os which still remains.1t is else-
where called‘ tumulus Augusti, &Caesar
u16n.’60r ‘Iuliorum’ See 3. 4, ι; 9, a,
1 2.

10. velut: see Introd. v. 5 67.

ι 1 . crudi adhue servitii, ‘ when slavery
had not ripened z ’ cp. ‘cruda marito’
Hor. Od. 3. 11, 12. Mr. Dallin would
take it to mean ‘ when slavery was not yet
incorporated into their system‚' the metae*

phor being that of an undigested meal ⁷

(cp. Juv. 1, 143; ‘cruda studia’ Petron.
4, ete.). Mr. F rost takes the metaphor
to be that of an unhealed wound.

12. occisus caesar. On this use of the
participle, see Introd. v. §.55 b.
