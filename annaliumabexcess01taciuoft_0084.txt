quoted of Tiberius makes him express by that. title his relation, not' '⁷
to the senate, but to the citizens¹; and the earlier Greek writers render
the word by ἡγεμώνῖ. It is therefore probably to be considered as

a separate designation, originating at the same date, which had become
confounded with ‘princeps senatus’ (πρόκριτος τῆς γερουσίας), by the time
of Dio. Such a term would seem to convey no more than the fact
that Caesar was the foremost citizen of Rome; and had been so used
of Pompeius by Cicero ³ and Sallust ⁴. Even long after it had become
distinctive, it is still used informally by the elder Pliny of Servilius
Nonianus⁵; and at all times so far refused to pass into a definite title,
that it never appears in the regular list of those borne by the Caesar, ³
and when used at all in inscriptions, has almost always some personal
term of honour accompanying it, as ‘ princeps optimus,’ ‘princeps et
conservator ξ’ etc.

His new position is, as it were, consecrated by the title of Augustus,
decreed hythe senate⁷‚ and assumed on the 16th of January 727, B.c. 27⁸;
a title expressive of sanctity, and a step to the divine honours paid to him, y
even during life, in various parts of the empire⁹. This title is always ,
distinctive of the ‘ princeps‚' and until the division of the empire in later ν
times, is shared with no one.

In the middle of 731, nc. 23, Augustus closed his series of consul-
ships, afterwards holding this office twice only, each time for a few days, .
on the introduction of his grandsons to public life10. His domestic Α
magistracy was now formally limited to the tribunitian power, which from ‚
this time is assumed as a title and reckoned annually from June 27 ¹¹.
There is no trace of annual re-election‚ and the object of the change
seems to be merely to substitute some other computation of his years of
rule for that supplied by his consulships. It has been thought that a τ
nomina] change was made from ‘ ius tribunitium ' to ‘ tribunitia potestas ¹²‚'
and that the power wasfurther defined and amplified. At the same time ¹
the powers of his ‘ proconsulare imperium ' were greatly extended ¹³.

A further step is marked, when he received, in 735, 13.c. 19, at first for Δ
