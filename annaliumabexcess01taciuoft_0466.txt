1. Apicio. Dio (57. 19, 5) gives the
name as Μάρκος Γάβιος Ἀπίκιος. He is
repeatedly mentioned in literature as the
great epicure of his age; but as Athenaeus
(1. 7, d; 4. 168, d) mentions two other
gourmands of the name, of much earlier
and later date respecffively, it would seem
that the name had passed on as a ‘ sou-
briquet’ from the first of them. See
Prof. Ramsay in Dict. of Biog.

2. veno dedisse. This construction,
only found here, is analogous to ‘dono
dare. ' The dative ‘veno ‘ appears to be
peculiar to Tacitus (cp. 13 51, 1; 14. 15,

3) as‘ venui' to Appuleius.

3. obscurum,‘ reservedz' cp Cic. Off.
3. 15, 5, Hor. Ep. 1. 18, 94, etc.

ἄπ. etp„ but answering to a common use
of ⁶ tectus.' ἱ

more crafty than Tiberius; therefore his
ascendancy over him was due to a divine
judgment against the state; or, in other
words, was inexplicable (555 note on 3.
30 )·

5.⁷pari exitio, by the crimes which he
prompted during his ascendancy, and by
the reign of 151101,- 511(1 utter shameless-
ness of Tiberius (6. 51, 6), following on
his fall.

6. corpus. cp. the description of his

‘physique' in Vell. 2.127, 3 ‘sufficienti
etiam vigori animi compage corporis)

tolerans, with gen. only here and
in Colum.; but the e is analogous to
many othe⁵rs (Introd. v. §34 c). In the
wholye passage, Tacitus has evidently
in view Sallust's description of Catiline

(Cat. 5).

7. obtegens: cp. 1. 76, 2; used with 1
gen. here only; but analogously to the .-
usage with other participles (Introd. ν. 5 “
33 d). Seianus himself is here supplied
as subject.

iuxta, ‘were side by side:’ so used
of a plurality of objects, in Pliny (N. ,
111. 36. 15, 24, 117) ‘theatra duo iuxta ²,
ecit? >⁴

8. compositus. Nipp. appears rightly ’
to take this to mean ‘tran quil‚’ noting
that the sense of artificial assumption (cp.
c. 31, 4, ete.) 15 here already given by the ⁴
contrast‘ palam’. ‘intus' ἑ

summa. That this is probably nent. ἶ
pl. is shown by 11. 26, 5 ‘summa adep· =
tus.'

9. industriaaovigilantia. The glow- ’

rme in isrespec.

11. modicam antea. The importanoe 3⁴
which Dio (52. 24) makes Maecenas as· ”
cribe to the office, appears to belong to α’
later date. On its Subsequent history ands ,’.’

according to Suetonius (Aug. 49), kept
most of them 111 nei ghbouring towns, reg*
taining only three' 111 Rome, 5 id those 11άῖ
concentrated. One‘ cohors togata’ (55οῗ
011 3. 4, 2) was always on guard at the
Palatium or in attendance on the emperor
elsewhere (cp. 12. 69, 1, etc..) .

12. una in castra. The 5115515111111·Γ
