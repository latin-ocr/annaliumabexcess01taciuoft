clamitans, reduxit in hiberna turbidos et nihil ausos.

1 . de imperatore rapti. These words

contain the explanation of ‘ turpi agmine? meant, as they do nm appear to have left ·

headquarters (cp. c. 35, 2: 39, 1).

The moneybags may indeed have been
unusually paraded on this occasion;
otherwise, the practice of depositing
money with the standards. in custody of
the standard bearers, was encouraged,
and even to some extent enforced, to
make the soldier thrifty, and to bind him
to the colours (Veg. 2, 20). Domitian
however considered it advisable to limit
each man's deposit to 1000 H. S. (Suet.
Dom. 7).

2. superiorem: cp. c. 31, 2. On
these legions, see Introd. vii. p. 103.

7. in Chaucis, This tribe occupied a
very large space (G. 35), apparently on
either side os the lower Weser. Pliny
(N. H. 16. 1, 1, 2) divides them into
‘maiores’ and ‘minores ς’ of whom the
latter, along the coast between the Weser
and Ems (cp. 2. 24. 3). were under Ro-
man control (cp. c. 60, 3); but, like
their neighbours the.Frisii (4. 72, 1),
appear afterwards to have revolted (ΙΙ.
1851; H. 4. 79, 3; 5.,19‚ 23 Suet. Cl.
ι 24 .

coeptavere. This verb, rare else-
where in prose, is often used by Tacitus
to ex ress an attempt, whether successful
or efflei-wisc: cp. c. 45, 2; 2‘. 81, 13 4.
19’8fieax4ill2r‘ii? ‘detachments.’ The
‘veterani‘ sub vexillo’ cannot be here

discordium, ⁶ disaffected.’ Thus ‘ dis-
sideat ' (c. 46, 1); ‘ discordare ' (3.
40, 4); ‘discordia’ (H. 2. 76, 9). etc„
are used of soldiers, not as disagreeing
amdong themselves, but as insubordinate
an mutlnous.

9. M'. Ennius. The MS. has ‘Men-
nius‚’ which is not a known Roman
name ; and the correction is supported by
the error ‘Lennium’ for L. Ennium in 3.
70. 2, and by the general practice of men-
tioning officers of this rank by two names
(c. πο, 1 ; 13. 39, π). The preferefl'ei of
Μ’, rather than M, as the praenomen.
rests on a suggestion of the possible iden·
tity of this person with a Μάνιος ''Et-mos
mentioned in the Pannonian war (Dio,
55· 33, 2)-

610. concesso iure: see on c. πο, ι;
2 ‚ 3. ,
1 1 . intumescente motu: cp. ‘quoniam
Galliae tumeant’ (H. 2. 32, ι). Similar
metaphors, originating apparently in the
‘ monet . . . tumescere bessa’ of Verg. G.
1. 465, are found in Liv.. etc.

15. ripam. No river has been mention-
ed: we should hence suppose the bank to
be that of the Rhine‚ as in e. 36, 2; but
the position of the Chauci would make a
more distant river, such as the Amisia,
more probable.

16. hiberna. Probably at ‘Vetera3’
