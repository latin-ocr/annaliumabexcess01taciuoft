‘fuere' may be supplied, or, as Nipp.
notes, ‘egere' may be used twice, like
‘antistent ' in 2. 33. 5. Such persons as
the triumvir and his father may be here
referred to.

1. Paulo Fabio L. Vitellio. The
former is probably son of the person men-
tioned in 1. 5, 1 ; he is recorded as ‘ pon·
tifex, sodalis Augustalis, frater Arvalis,’
in an inscription at Ephesus (C. I. L. iii. 2,
6073), and appears in the Arval Tables
from 774 to 807, ΑΛ). 21-—54 (C. Ι. L. vi. 1,
2023 b-2035), and is also noticed as a
profligate friend of Claudius (Sen. de Ben.

lius, here first mentioned, is the proconsul
of Syria in c. 32, 5, sqq„ and the well-
known courtier of Claudius (11. 3, 1,
etc.), under whom he obtained a second
and third consulship and a censorship.
He also appears among the Arvales from
781 to 807, A.D. 28—54 (C. 1. L. vi. 1,
2026-2035M and was father of the em·
peror A. Vitellius (H. 1. 9, 2, etc.).

2. avis phoenix . . . venit. Dio (58.
27, 1) and Pliny (N. H. 10. 2, 5), who
cites as his authority Cornelius Valerianus,
date this event in the consulship of Plautius
and Papinius (see c. 40. Ι). Tacitus would
hardly have intentionally introduced it out
og its place without saying so (as in c.

(11. 14, 1). Hdt., who had seen it, ὅσον “
γραφῇ, describes it (2. 73) as in form an ,

eagle, but with

golden and red feathers. ]

Pliny (1.1.) goes more into detail; and a ς

poem on„the bird, attributed to Lactantius, ›·

describes it still more fully (125-150) as
paitaking os the plumage of the

and pheasant, with a rayed creet. On η

monuments it has the form of a heron,
and is connected with symbols of Osiris.

de numero annorum. The phoe· ,

nix was seen to be the symbol of a cycle
of time, but its period was very differently
given. That of 1461 years is the Egyp-
tian ‘ annus magnus, also mlled the
Sothiac, or Canicular period, being that
in which the year of 365 days agrees with
that of 365‡; 1461 ofthe one being equal
to 1460 of the other The year ΑΛ). 130

was reckoned by the Egyptians as the end

of one such period (see Sir G. C. Lewis, .

Astronomy of the Ancients, p. 284).
Those who reekon the phoenix cycle at
500 years (Hdt. l. 1.; Ov. Met. 15, 395;
Sen. Ep. 42, 13 Mela. 3. 8, 10) possibly
take it as a round number for one-third
of the above cycle (487 years), or as itself

a period of correction of the calendar (see ’

Nipp.). Pliny (1. 1.) gives, on the autho-

rity os Manilius, a phoenix cyele of 5⁴0 ’
years, and elsewhere (²9· 1, 9, 29) speaks ³

of it loosely as 1000 years, m which
Lactantius (v. 59) follows him. For

other periods given, see Lewis, p. 283, >
