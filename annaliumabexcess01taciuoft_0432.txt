whereas a rich knight or freedman would
probably only leave off luxury through
surseit.

1. aut si, etc. ‘On the other hand, if ¹
etc.

3.‘ hune ego, etc.
the natural order of the words is varied to
emphasize ‘ hunc' in relation to ‘ si quis.’

exonerari, ‘is being removed.' The
verb has this sense in H. 5. 2, 3 ‘ multi-
tudinem . . . exoneratam,’ and in several
other instances cited by Nipp. from Plau-
tus, Livy, L. Seneca, and Lucan.

ν 5. simultates faciunt: cp. ‘saepe si-
multates ira morata facit ' Ov. Am. 1. 8,

the sense of ‘not either' (11. 13, 35 15.

are instanced by N ipp. here: cp. Drager‚

9. remissa aedilibus talis eura, ‘ the
aediles were excused from such a duty)
i.e. frotn that of an en'ergetic enforcement
of the laws. The laws were left unalter-
ed, a¹nd their violation tacitly ignored.
On ‘remissa’ cp. 1. 8, 6. It would how—

ever appear from Suet. Tib 34 (cp. also
Pl. N. H. 33. 2, 8, 32), that Tiberius did
at some time place the market under se-
natorial supervision and enjoined on the
aediles a strict control of ‘popinae’ and
‘ganeae'

to this meaning are found in Cic„ Liv,
etc.

11. rerum adeptus. The genitive with
this verb (cp. 12. 30, 4) and with ‘apis-
cor’ (6. 45, 6) is peculiar to Tacitus.
The construction, which is analogous to
that of ‘ potior‚’ is apparently taken from
that of τυγχάνειν.

practised‚ but have since gradually gone
out of fashion.’ Two distinct statements

other instances given here by Nipp.
