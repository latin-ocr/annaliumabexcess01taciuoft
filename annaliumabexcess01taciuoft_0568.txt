of the proposal,’ i. e. its omission from
the ‘acta' (cp.5.4, 1), without any
penalty to the proposer. In the insertion
of‘ ut,’ Halm follows Doed. Nipp. alters
‘’neque to ‘,’neve taking ‘moderans’

with a double construction; others read
‘’suadere as historical infinitive.

1.-Iunium Gallionem. M. Seneca,

one of whose sons was adopted by this
Gallio (see on 15. 73, 4), names him as
forming, with Latro, Fuscus, and Albu-
cifuls1,atquarg{t ot} the ἰοτεῐιιοεξ diplaimegs

rated him lower, as would appear from
such expressions as ‘tinnitus Gallionis’

(Dial. 26, 1), ⁴ remissius et pro suo inge-
nio . . . Gallio ' (Quint. 9. 2, 91). Ovid
addresses to him a condolence on the
death of his wife (ex P. 4. 1 1).

aetia stipendiis. They served six-
teen years (1. ι7, o).

2. in quattuordecim ordinibus. This
would give them an equestrian dignity,
such as was usually the reward of a ‘pri-
m6ipilaris: ’ see Marquardt, Staatsv. ii p.

3. velut eoram3 i. e. turning upon him
in the letter as if sace to face.

Nipp., who had previously suggested‘ nisi
e praetorio: now follows Rhenanus in

reading‘ nisi imperatoris? which appears
to be the simplest emendation.- The in-

' genuity of Ritter's conjecture‘ imperiti

oratoris' (see Rhein. Mus. 16. p. 130)
also deserves mention The MS. text
could no doubt be understood as ‘the
word of command’ (cp. 2. 45, 3), and the
whole sentence taken to mean that none
could come between them and their gen-

eral as regarded word or deed3 but the

close recurrence of ‘imperator‘ in two
distinct senses is awkward In any case
‘praemia' is emphatic, and ‘dicta‘ thrown
in to complete the statement. The re-
sentment here expressed by Tiberius at
senatorial interference with any matter
relating to the army is strongly contrasted,
if not wholly inconsistent, with his un-
usual reference of such questions to it at
an earlier date (1. 26, 5, etc.): see Momm-
sen, Staatsr. ii. p. 915.

5. prorsus, used bitterly, as in 4. 52, 5.

7. ad corrumpendum militiae mo-
rem, ‘to breaeh of discipline ;' by, as

Dio (58. 18, 4) expresses it, leading them *
to look to the state rather than their ‘im- ᾗ

pegtcirrieusabatur, etc. This verb, which
has an accus. and inf. in 3.
Liv.‚ appears to have the nom. and inf.

only here and in Amm. ¹4· ιι, 24 ‘cum ν’
altius niti incusaretur.’ The construction ,s
is analogous to that of many other verbs J

of accusing (Introd. v. ξ 45).

kinds of custody are mentioned by Ulp ian ’ἶ
(Dig. 48. 3, 1) as within the discretion of τ’
the consul‘ utrum in carcerem recipienda .j.

This ‘libera ,ι-

trates besides the consuls (Sall. Cat. 4,7
