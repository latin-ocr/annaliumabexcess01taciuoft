fifteen ‘ oppida civium Romanorum: and six coloniae¹ ; the most famous s
towns in these two latter classes respectively being Utica and Carthage ².

Our record of African events at this time mentions only the predatory
warfare of Tacfarinas ³ ; but there is abundant other evidence that Africa
was in many respects the most important senatorial government, and
therefore with reason the most jealously watched by Caesar. Next to
Egypt it was the most important source of the corn supply of Italy⁴;
and, probably on this account, the proconsul was assisted or controlled
not by one, but by two or more ‘ procuratores fisci ¹⁵.’ Again, here alone ·
the senatorial proconsul has regular command of a legion ⁶, and the
chance of winning military renown; an exceptional position which Gaius
removed by introducing the anomaly of a co-ordinate ‘ legatus Augusti,'
who had command of the troops, and, apparently, also some territorial
government ⁷.

The Caesarian provinces can be classified in three ranks‚ of which the
two first answer to the two classes of senatorial provinces; the legati
being in the greatest provinces always of consular, and in those of the
second class, of praetorian rank ⁸ ; although, in recognition of the ‘pro-
consulare imperium' as vested in Caesar, all have the uniform title of
‘legati Augusti propraetore‚’ and the same insignia of five fasces, with the
military dress and sword ⁹ 3 their difference of rank being only noted by
the addition to their titles of ‘vir consularis ¹⁰,' by those who were such.
To the highest class belong all those provinces involving important
military commands 3 of which the following had been established at the
death of Augustus ¹¹ ε 1. Hispania Tarraconensis 3 2. Germania superior ;
3. Germania inferior; 4. Pannonia; 5. Moesia; 6. Dalmatia (with Illyri-
cum); 7. Syria (with Cilicia) ¹². The second class, as constituted at the
same period, will comprise : 1. Lusitania3 2. Aquitania; 3. Gallia Lug-
dunensis ; 4. Gallia Belgica ¹³ ; 5. Galatia ¹⁴3 6. Pamphylia. Athird class
