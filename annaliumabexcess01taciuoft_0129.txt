  

ROME UNDER AUGUSTUS ΛΝΒ TIBERIUS. 111

ξ’ ical order was connected with the sacred ideas of domestic security; not
only in Rome and Italy, but in many parts of the empire ¹. To this was
added afterwards throughout the empire the later cult of the ‘ Divus
’ Augustus¹' and his deified successors 3 as also in some cases, that of the
, living Caesar, associated with the imperial city⁸z the whole forming a
ν 'kind of apotheosis of order and peace, which appears to have been for
, the present the nearest approach to an universal religion.
y Otherwise there was more interchange than fusion of manifold reli-
’ gions. Temples to Jupiter Capitolinus are found in provinces ⁴ ς and, in
turn, whatever was attractive in provincial religions struck root in Rome;
= and supplied, what the colder forms of the state ritual failed to supply,
some food for the fervour of religious enthusiasm and for speculative
¹ theology. Many foreign religions obtained special licence, and even the
r illicit might enioy practical impunity, till circumstances pointed attention
‘g to them3 as in the suppression of Isiac rites by Agrippa⁸5 or the stern
ξ vengeance taken by Tiberius on the priests of this cult for a flagrant
Τ moral scandal ⁸ ; or the deportation of Jews arising out of a gross pecu·
niary fraud ' z the penalty being apparently in neither case such as sensibly
to abate the prevalence of such worships.
ζ Nor could any coercion keep out the forbidden mysteries of astrology
ξ and magic’ 3 the former of which had the direct countenance of Tibe-
ἶ rius, though his protection of Thrasyllus· did not interfere with the
f chastisement of the meaner herd ¹⁰. The influence of all foreign super-
stitious on a less strong mind may be seen in the case of Germanicum
in the restless search after foreign oracles, worships, miracles ¹¹, which
seems to have so far guided his movements in the East; and in the
belief shared by his friends as well as himself, that the magician was as
' capable of causing his death as the poisoner ¹⁸.
ζ Meanwhile, the only religion capable of taking the place both of the
, effete ideas of old Roman worship,and of the gross fanaticisms of foreign
, superstition, was known as yet only to a few poor Jews, and hardly
reaches to the outer world till the time of Claudius ²¹.
