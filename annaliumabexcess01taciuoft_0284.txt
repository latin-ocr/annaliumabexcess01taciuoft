a more violent change, ‘Apronius ² (cp.
1. 56, 1; 72, 1) sor ‘Anteius.' It iscer·
tainly strange to find an unknown person
mentioned by one name only, side by side

3. fessas Gallias, etc. In 1. 71, 3,
these supplies were said to have been
eagerly offered.

5. promptam ipsis, etc.‚ ‘it was an

clement which they could readily occupy,
and was unfamiliar to the enemy’ (the
Germans having no ships). On this use
of ‘promptus,’ cp. c. 2, 6; 1. 68, 1, etc.
On the strategic sense of ‘possessio‚' cp.
‘possessa Vicetia,’ ‘ Mevania' H. 3. 8, 2 ;
59, 1·

6. maturius incipi. N ipp. notes that
the sea route is practicable earlier in the
season than the forest roads; also that,
as the following words imply, the march
is not retarded by the baggage. In the
expedition of Tiberius from the Rhine to
the Elbe in 758, A.D. 5, the army marched
by land, but was supported by a fleet-

9. huo intendit : cp. 3. 37, 35
‘illuc intenderat' H. 4. 79, 3; ‘huc in-
clinarat’ H. 3. 27, Ἰ. The full expression
(⁶ intendere animum alicui rei ⁹) occurs in
c. 61, 1, etc. ν

P. vitellio: see 1. 70, 1. The con-
jecture of Orsini, reading ‘C. Antio’
for the MS. ‘ Canti0,’ is supported by the
occurrence of the name C. Antius Titi fi.
on a·votive inscription found at Langres
(Orelli 1415). Nipp. introduces below

with Silius and Caecina; but it is more
probable that a praenomen ‘A ” οι· ⁴ T’
may have dropped out.

1 2. ubero. This word, though nowhere
else used for the ‘ alveus' of a ship, is
used of the wooden horse (Verg. Aen. 2,
52), and of a ‘dolius’ (Col. 12. 4, 5).

1 3. planae carinis. Similar ships were
built to attack Mona (14. 29, 3). and the
Gauls used such in Caoear’s time ‘ quo
facilius vada ac decessum aestus excipere
possent' Β. G. 3. 13, 1. ·

used on the Euxine (H. 3. 47, 4), and by
the Suiones (G. 44, 2).

15. pontibus. ΤΙιε word appears no-
where else to mean a ‘ deck: though the
‘ pontes' of a tower have been taken to
mean its floors in Verg. Aen. 9, 5305 υ,

the midships is meant, which would have .

the appearance of a bridge when viewed
from the prow or stern.

subject of reference throughout, so that
Ern's correction ‘quos,’ as referring to
‘ pontes‚' is needless.
