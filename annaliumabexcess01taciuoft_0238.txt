1. Bructeros. This tribe, divided in-
to ‘maiores’ and ‘minores,' appear to

- have occupied a tract between the Lippe

and the upper part of the Ems, near the
modern Miinster‚ and on both sides of
the former river. (Strab. 7.1, 3, 291).
They had been reduced by Tiberius (Vell.
2. 105, 1), but had risen against Varus,
one of whose eagles they had captured
(e. 60, 4). They take part in the rising
of Civilis (H. 4. 21, 33 61, 3, etc.); and
later history <see Dict. of Geog.) contra-
dicts the statement of Tacitus (G. 33, Ι),
that they had been annihilated by his own
time.

Tubantes. These are mentioned
in 13. 55, 5; 56, 63 and, though not
noticed in the ‘ Germania,’ were known
to Ptolemy‚ and much later (see Dict. of
Geog.). They appear to have moved
gradually from their original locality near
the Yssel in a south easterly direction
(see on 13. 55, 5), and to have lived at
this time south of the Ruhr.

Usipetes. These are elsewhere
called ‘Usipi’ (e.g. 13. 55, 5; 56, 6),
and closely joined with the Tencteri (G.
32²3 fitififfzlmsshffgfit Ysson‘sffihff? ¹1¹2}ss
of the Lower Province. The Usipi fur-
nish a cohort to the army of Britain in
the time of Domitian (Agr. 28, Ι), but

¹ are unknown after the date of the ‘ Ger-

mania)

2. gnamm: ep. c. 5, 4.

incessitque itineri et proelio, ‘he
ordered his advance alike for march-
ing and fighting.’ Such a disposition of
troops is similarly described in ¹3- 40, z
‘viae pariter et pugnae composuerat ex-

ercitum;’ and in Curtius (3, 8) by ‘iti-
neri simul paratus et praelio? On this
use of the dative, see note on c. 23, 6.
The chief peculiarity here consists in the
absence tthrough use of an intransitive
verb) of the substantive on which such

dative usually more or less depends (see ’

Roby, 1156). ‘ Incessit' has the force of
‘incessum instituit,’ as ‘honori decucur-
rit' (2. 7, 4) is equivalent to ‘honori de·
cursum duxit‚’ and as ‘signum’ is snp-
plied in the phrase ⁴ receptui canere?

3. auxiliariae cohortes. As it is
plain from what follows that these did
not all march in sront, the suggestion
of Nipp. is probable, that some numeral,
such as x, may have dropped out aster,
or become altered into, ‘ et.¹

ducebant; absolutely, as ἡγοῦμαι
is often used. The arrangement, nearly
the same as in c. 64, 8, is one of the
forms of the ‘quadratum agmen,’ other
dispositions of which are given in Mar-
quardt. Staatsv. ii. p. 411.

6. porrigeretur. This verbis here used
of extension of columns in file, more
usually of extension in line (as H. 5. 16,
1; Agr· ³5. 4)· Th , h B,
ve35,2‘s²⁸f2¹1³53¹‡i⁵2{}22 widi iffi&- {12¹3
⁴ evasere ⁷ below, are instances of the
fondness of Tacitus for such constructione
with compound verbs: see Introd. v. §
1 2 c. ‘Adsultare,’ a word not apparently
found earlier than in Pl. mai„ and chiefly
in Tacitus, is elsewhere used by him with
a dat. (asxa. 13, 4, etc.)‚ or absol. (as 11.

1 ‚ etc.,.
3 510⁵. illud tempus, ‘the opportunity
they had desired ’ (c. 49, 5).
