operum Batavis delegat' (H. 4. 28, 5);
but it seems doubtful whether ‘ductus
aquarum' may not have acquired the
meaning, which it appears to have later,
of the actual conduit or aqueduct itsels.

2. aerarii praetoribus. Augustus
transferred charge of the ‘ aerarium ' from
quaestore to praetors in 726, Β. C. 28 (Suet.
Aug. 36; Dio, 53. 2, ι); and the reversal
os this change by Claudius was again
reversed by Nero (13Δ 29, 2; H. 4. 9, 1).

3. tribuit, as a gift from the ‘ fiscus!

erogandae . . . cupiens. Many in-
stances are recorded of his liberality to
individuals (2. 37, 1 ; 48, 1 ; 86, 23 4.
64, 1; 6.17‚ 4; 45, 1) and to provincial
states (2. 47, 3ς 4.
(Tib. 47, 48) speaks depreciatingly of
these acts. The genitive with ‘ cupiens,’
used by Tacitus in the Annals only (6. 46,
2; 14. 14‚4; 15. 46, 13 72, 4316.6,1)‚
seems to be an instance in which he has
gone back to a Plautine usage.

4. diu. Even the absence of criminal
covetousness (3. 18, 2) is represented as
afterwards no longer characterising him:
see 4. 2ο, 2; 6. 19, 1 ; and several stories
collected in Suet. Tib. 49. As regards
his munificence‚ we must set against these
insinuations the sact.that one, at least. of
its chief instances (see above) is among
the last acts of his life. ,

5. veniam ordinis, ‘leave to resign
senatorial rank.‘ Frost notes the special
application of ⁸ ordo ’ to the senate (e. g.
13. 11, 25 32, 2), and to its municipal
comiter-part (13· 48, 13 H. 2. 52, 3).

deciens sestertium. This sumhad been
fixed as the senatorial census by Au·
gustus' (Dio, 54. 17, 3), who had be-
stoweda similar gift on Hortalus (2. 37, 2).

13, 1). Suetonius

6. paternas, ⁸ inherited.’ i. e. not due
to his own extravagance. So again 3.
32, 2.

7. alios: Seneca (de Ben. 2. 7, 2) men-
tions Marius Nepos, on whom see 2.48‚ 3.

8. acerbus. The demand sor prooi
was ‘rite sactum 3 ' the publicity imposed .
on it is here called harshness. Dio (57.
10, 4) says that he also paid over his gists
openly ; finding that those privately given
by Augustus had often been filched in
transit.

10. Tiberis, etc. The frequency of
these inundations is noted throughout
Roman History (cp. Gibbon, ch. 71 3 Me-
rivale, ch. xli.; F riedltinder, i. p. 27, etc.);
and, notwithstanding the rise of the soil
by accumulations, still requires a remedy.

11. stagnaverat, ‘ had flooded.' The
verb is mostly poetical and post-Augustam,
and the transitive sense very rare. Cp.
(‘ loca) stagnata paludibus' Ov. Met. 15,
26 .

gelabentem . . . strages. Probably
‘relabentem' is aoristic (see Introd. v.
ξ 54 a), and ‘strages’ is to be taken in
two senseS, of the sall of buildings, and
of mortality among human beings; 'the
probability being that the stagnant water
may have bred a pestilence, which was the
most usual occasion for consulting the
Sibylline books. In the account of a
similar flood in H. 1. 86, 2, the river
is described as ‘strage obstantis molis
refusus‚' ‘strages' having its more proper
meaning of a confused heap. To make
the passage here mean that such a
mingled mass of building material and
human bodies was carried along with the
retiring waters, we should require ‘seque-
batur:’ but it may possibly be meant
