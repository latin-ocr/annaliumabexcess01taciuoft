s Germanicus ¹, and thus to prejudice the position of his son by blood,
ξ Drusus, who was a year or two younger. Even the prospect osa possible

civil war could not turn the old man from a scheme which might one
day bring back the inheritance of the Caesars to his own direct descend-

ants. Hence the undisguised coldness and jealousy os Tiberius and

Livia towards Germanicus and his house, and the suspicions, not the less
real became baseless, that the young man might turn his popularity to
ἰζ disloyal use ; hence the idea that even Agrippa, though sormally banished
’ in perpetuity‚ was still formidable while he lived, and might any day
ν return to favour ².

Augustus again, while addressing Tiberius by letter in a sulsome strain
of pdpable exaggeration ⁸, is said to have osten jested to his courtiers
v about the poor Roman people, who were to be ‘ so deliberately masti-
ῥζ αἰθᾶς ’ often to have broken off lively conversation at his approach·-
Ξ and even in a public rescript to have ‘taunted him with his personai

peculiarities under colour os apology ⁶.' The epigrammatists who did not

ξ’ spat-e Tiberius even as prince ⁸, assuredly did not spare him all this time';
and even a posthumous stroke was dealt in the will which made him
principa! heir, by a pointed allusion to those who should have filled his
place ⁸.

Such circumstances, acting on such a temperament, produced much
such a character as we should expect. We are to think of the man
Tiberius as one naturally austere, reserved‚ and distant’; the best of
whose lise had been spent in eamps or in retirement 5 whose position at
court had been generally more or less overshadowed by rivals; and
whose domestic lise had been wrecked for political objects in which he
had no primary interest3 while he had been schooled sor years in repres-
sion and disguise, with satalists always at his elbow to tell him that his
day of revenge would come ¹⁰. He had lived in the coldest shade os

; neglect, as well as in the sun sunshine os flattery, and could rate the

homage os senate and people at its proper worth. Os all views os his
[1 character, none is more amply borne out by facts than that which states

, that his resolution was as ναὶ as his penetration was keen ¹¹ ς so that.

³ the more clearly he eottld read men’s minds, the more he was at a lose
