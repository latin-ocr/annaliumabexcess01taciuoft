adopted by Tacitus from Livy.
1. extractum. This implies some

compulsion, but not necessarily physieal eagle is not to be consounded with the

7. aquilifer. The actual bearer of the .

force: cp. ‘contuberniis extracti’ (15. 13,
2); ‘rure extractus in urbem ’ (Hor. Sat.
1. 1, 11). The case is probably abl„ as
in Horace (1. l.); but in 6. 23, 5, the
MS. text ‘extractum custodiae' is gene-
rally accepted.

3. consternatione, ‘the tumult:' cp.
c. 63, 3: 13. 16, 6, etc. This noun ap—
pears to originate with Livy, but the verb
(cp. H. 3. 79, 3) is found earlier.

5. eastra primae legionis. Each
legion had always more or less separate
winter quarters, though the two here may
have been in distinct portions of a eom-
mon enclosure. The context implies per-
haps that his assailants followe'd him into
this camp, and certainly that some of the
legion, who are addressed as guilty by
Germanicus, attacked him there.

6. religione: see note on c. 18, 2. On
the sanctity of the eagles and other stan-
dards, ep. 2. 17, 2, and ‘conversus ad

to have been kept in oemp in a portable
shrine. Even in old times it was a prac-
tice to swear by the standards (see Liv-
26. 48, ‘12). Other evidence of their

‘centurio primi pili' who had charge os
it, but is an officer of much lower rank,
mentioned in several inscriptions. See
Henzen, Index.

rarum etiam, etc. On such pa-
rentheses, see Introd. v. 5 82. A similar
outrage on ‘legati ‘ is similarly spoken of
in H. 3. 80, 3.

9. altaria deum. These, as well as the
standards and the image of the emperor,
stood in the principia. See 4. 2, 4.

10. noscebantur, ‘ were capable of re-
cognition:’ cp. 4. 62, 5; H. 1. 90, 3.

ingressus eastra : see above.

11. imperat recepitque. The histo·
rical present is easily interchangeable
grith a perfect, as 2. 7, 13 20, ²5 14. 4,

, etc.

12. fatalem increpans rabiem. ‘Ra-
bies' is thus used of mutiny in c. 31, 3.
The use of ‘fatalem' (cp. 5. 4η 2; 15. 6‘1,
6; and note on 3. 30, 2), which is ex-
plained by ‘deum ira‘ (cp. 16. 16, 3),
treats them as hardly responsible beings,
and sostens the censure conveyed in ‘in-
crepans;' from which word some such
sense as that of ‘dicens' is supplied by
⁴ zeugma ' with ‘ resurgere!

13. ius legationis, sc. ⁴ violatum.’
On such pregnant constructions‚ see In·
trod. v. ξ 84.

1 5. miseratur, ⁴ expresses sorrow sor.'
