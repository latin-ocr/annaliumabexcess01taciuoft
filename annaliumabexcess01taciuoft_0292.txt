CORNELII TACITI ANNALIUM [A. U. C. 769.

distinguunt' G. 6, 2. Orelli traces in
this the origin of the mediaeval devices
on shields.

1. utcumque, ‘somehow5’ i. e. the
lances, such as they were (their defects
having been already noted), were con-
fined to the front rank. Tine word is
here best taken closely with ‘ hastatam 3 ’
as in 12. 51, 2 (⁴ primam utcumque fugam
. . . toleravit’), with ‘ toleravit.’ Its use
in this way, as limiting a verb or par-
ticiple, is especially frequent in Livy (e. g.
2Δ . 15, 1 .

92. breiria. These would be the ‘fra-
meae' described in G. 6, 1, as ‘angusto
et brevi ferr0‚' and as the German general
weapon for distant and close fighting.
The ‘praeusta tela’ would have no iron
head at all.

eorpus: see below, c. 21, 1, and the
description in G. 4, 1 ‘omnibus truces
et caerulei oculi, rutilae comae. magna
corpora et tantum ad impetum valida)

- The military qualities of the Gauls are

similarly described in Liv. 5. 44, 4; 10.
28:macine pudore, etc. To give way
before a direct attack was part of their
regular tactio (G. 6, 6); but the chival-
rous eourage of at least the chiefs and
their ‘comitatus’ is celebrated· (Id. 14, 2).

changed (e.g. c. 6, 4; 4. 2, 1; 46, μ
11. 21, 4, etc.: cp. Dr. Synt. und Stil,
5 105), but probably here Nipp. is right
in taking -‘ adversis· as an abbreviated

abl. abs. akin to those noted in Introd. V.
ξ 31. He considers this also the proper
explanation of ‘firmus adversis' Agr. 35,
δὲ ‘sperat infestis, metuit secundis Hor.

. 2. 10, 13·

5. viarum ac maris: one of the few
direct reminiscences of Horace apparent
in Tacitus: see Introd. v. §- 97.

7. ultr-a. Nipp. thinks this alludes to
the neutral ,or friendly attitude of Maro-
boduus and the Suevi beyond the Elbe
(see c. 44, etc.). It might also be meant
that no resistance could remain if theg
crushed the force now opposed to them. '

patris patruique. Drusus had reached
the Elbe in 745, B.c. 9 (Dio, 55. 1, 2);
and Tiberius in 758, Α. D. 5 (Vell. 2. 106,
2). On the use of ‘patrui' here, see on
1.. 3.3h?stemnt: cp. ‘ut eum in Syria . . .
sisterent‘ H. 2. 9, 2: and the uses in
Vergil, as ὀ qui me . . . sistat’ G. 2,
488; ‘te limine sistam’ Aen. 2, ⁶203
‘ classem Cretaeis sistet in oris' Aen. 3,
117.

11. hos esse . . . fugacissimos. There
were some survivors of that disaster in
the present army (cp. 1. 61, 6); and the·
preservation of the reserve force of two .
legions under Asprenas (Vell. 2. 120, r)
may give more colour to the sarcasm,
in which Tacitus appears to imitate that
already ascribed by him to Agricola, ‘ii
ceterorum Britannorum fugacissimi, ideo·
que tamdiu superstites‘ (Agr. 34, ι).

1 2. induerint. The metaphoris usually
that of assuming a character (cp. 1. 69,
2), not necessarily a false one; but it is
here meant that mutiny was a mere pre·
text to get out of service.
