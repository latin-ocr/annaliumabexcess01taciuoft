THE SPNTAX ΛΝΒ SJYLE 011* TA CITUS. 49

  

g here a sentence with quod would be expected. One or two
ssmch instances are found in Cicero, none in Caesar or Sallust. Livy has
several such, as degeneratum, perlitatum, tentatum, etc. So Tacitus
ξ has nihil occultum 3. 9, 3; cuncta . . . composita 2. 57, ι, ete. For
the part. may stand a substantive (as 1. 19, 5 ; 33, 6), adjective (as
ἶ Η. 3. 64, ι), or pronoun (as 6. 47, 4). Dr. ξ 211, Madv. 426, obs. 1,
,ἒ Roby 1411, Nipp. on 3. 9; 6. 47.

VI. prepositions.

· ⁶6. Many usages connected with these have been alteady noticed,
i meh as their omission (ξς 5, 10, ι3 c, 21, 24, 25, 36, 37, 3ο), and the
z· substitution os other expressions, where constructions with prepositions
would be usual (ἕξ ι5, 18, 3ο, 33 e, 37). On the anastrophe of preps.,
· see 5 78. See also Nipp. on 3. 68; and, for other usages not noticed
g in the following sections, see Dr. ξς 80-105.

’ 57. Apud is used, never in the minor writings, rarely in the Histoi-ies,
t and very often in the Annals, with the names of places and countries,
ζ or, analogously, with general names, where a simple locutive, or the
, ablative with ἀι, would be usual, as apud urbem Nolam ι. 5, 5; Mi-
’ senum apud et Ravennam 4. 5, ις apud Rhodum 6. 3ο, 3, arae apud

'3 quas ι. 6ι, 5; apud paludes ι. 64, 3. Α few instances are found in
²* earlier prose. Dr. ς 83, Roby ι858, Nipp. on ι, 5, Gerber and Greef,
” Lex. ιν.

¹ 58. σίτοι has the metaphorical meaning of ‘concerning‚’ or ‘in
⁷ relation to;' as circa artes bonas ιι. ι5, ι; circa necem Gai Caesaris
ζ ιι. 39, ι 3 circa scelera ι6. 8, 3. This meaning appears to originate
ἶ with Seneca and Pliny mai.. and to be very frequent in Quintilian.
’ Dr. ἦ 86, Roby 1867.

τ 69. Bru· has the sense os ‘agninae or ‘in relation to‚' as fastus
erga-..epulas 3. 3, 5; erga Germanicum 3. 76, 3, fama erga...exitus
4. ιι, 33 anxii erga sanum 4. 74, 5, etc. These uses are very rare
before Tacims, and very prominent in his works. Dr. ξ 98, Roby ¹9 3 ι,
ι933. See the fun list of instanoes in Gerber and Greef, s. v.
