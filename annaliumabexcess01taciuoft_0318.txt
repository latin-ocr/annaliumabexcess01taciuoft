300 CORNELII TACITI ANNALIUM [A.U.C. 770. ,

inperitissimi cuiusque promtas aures aut rursum apud turbidos
eoque nova cupientes. atque ipse adire municipia obscuro diei, 5
neque propalam aspici neque diutius isdem locis, sed quia veritas

famam aut praeveniebat.

40. Vulgabatur interim per Italiam servatum munere deum 1
Agrippam, credebatur Romae; iamque Ostiam invectum multi-
tudo ingens, iam in urbe clandestini coetus celebrabant, cum Tibe-

10 rium anceps cura distrahere, vine militum servum suum coerceret
an inanem credulitatem tempore ipso vanescere sineret: modoa
nihil spernendum, modo non omnia metuenda ambiguus pudoris
ac metus reputabat. postremo dat negotium Sallustio Crispo.
ille e clientibus duos (quidam milites fuisse tradunt) deligit atque 8

15 hortatur, simulata conscientia adeant, offerant pecuniam, fidem
atque pericula polliceantur. ‹3st erat. dein 4

Agrippa factus esset, respondisse fertur ‘quo modo tu Caesar?

crebrescit, ‘the story grows.' The
verb is first found in Verg„ and is used
by Tacitus in this sense in H. 2. 67, 1;

to take ‘ celebrabant’ in the same sense
in both clauses, and it seems otherwise to
be implied that he was arrested within

but here alone with ace. and inf. The
more ordinary sense is found in 3. 60,
2, etc.

1. apud . . . rursum: see note on 1.
31⁹ 55 80⁹ 3·

3. obscuro diei: cp. ‘sero diei' c. 21,
43 ‘ obscuro . . . coeptae lucis’ H. 4.
50, 2.

5. incertis; in contrast to ‘visu,' as
¹ festinatione ' to ‘ mora! On such neuter
plurals used for abst. nouns, see Introd. v.
5 4 0·

valescunt: cp. 4. 61, ις 6. 42, 23
H. 1. 32, 4. The verb appears to be
taken from Lucr. 1. 942, ete.

relinquebat famam aut praeve-
niebat; i. e. whenhe left a place, it was
because he was becoming too well
known; when he chose another to visit,
it was one where the story had not spread.
We should rather have expected ‘ praeve-
niebat et relinquebat.’

9. celebrabant=‘colebant,’ as ‘ ob-
sequio aliquem celebrare’ 16. 33, 1: cp.
the similar use of ‘ frequentabatur' of the
pseudo-Drusus (5. 10, 3). It is thought
by Ritt. and Doed. that Clemens did not
venture into Rome 3 but it is more natural

th‘idlltiiuum, emphatic, as ‘ libertum
suum’ H. 2. 65, 3. The establish‘ment

of Agrippa, irrespectively of his bauish- ”

ment, vested strictly in Augustus as his
adoptive father (see Suet. Tib. 15); and

any slaves retained, when his property

was made over to the ‘aerarium militare ’ =

(Dio, 55. 32, 2), would have passed to
the heirs of Augustus.

’ 11. vanescere: cp. c. 82, 8; 4. 37, 53
5. 9, 1, etc. The verb is poetical, but in
Quint. and Pl. Ep.

12. ambiguus: cp. c. 24, 6.
13. Sallustio Crispo: see 1. 6, 6.
15. conscientia, ‘ complicity: '' cp.

‘conscii' 1. 48,

Agrippa, but that they understood his
plot, and would help it. ,ζ
16. pericula. This may possibly mean ²:

‘ daring deeds: as perhaps ‘ eviluissent, j
- pericula sua’ (H. 3. 53, 1); or the con⁴ r

struction may be pregnant (=‘ societatem
periculorum ’), as others noted in In- 7:
trcssfgufogn‘sodo Agrippa. Halm inclines
to agree with Wolfflin (Philol. 30, 744),

4, etc. Their pretenoe -
was not that they believed him to be ¹-
