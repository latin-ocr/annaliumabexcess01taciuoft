equiti Romano tradere meditatus est.

mirum hercule, si cums

in omnis curas distraheretur immensumque attolli provideret ³*

quem coniunctione tali super alios extulisset, C. Proculeium

and that the others, though not without
individual jealousies, were all of one
house.

1. intendatur: cp. 2. 57, 3, etc.

'falleris enim. On the sudden change·
to ‘oratio recta,' see Introd. v. ξ 94. The
connect10n of thought is, ‘you cannot
remain as you are ; such a wife must force
you into an ambitious position.’ The
whole of this passage to ‘permixt0s,’
especially the portion ‘vis tu . . . incu-
sant,' is made to contain a covert irony,
in allusion to the assumed humility of c.

. , 6.

3925112 eodem ordine, explained by
‘ equite Romano ’ below.

Gaio Caesari . . . nupta. This mar-
riage must have taken place before he
was sent to the East in 753, B.C. 1, when
she could hardly have been more than
twelve years old. The date of her mar-
riage with Drusus cannot be fixed.

4. ego ut sinam, ⁶ though 1 were to
permit itt’ see note on c. 38, 1.

5. fratrem, etc. Germanicus, the elder
Drusus, and the Claudii and Drusi of
former times.

6. vis tu quidem: see c. 39, 6.

sistere = ‘stare2' cp. H. 3. 21, 2:
with the exception of Varr. L. L. 5, 53,
this sense is previously wholly poetical
(e. g. Verg. G. 1, 479 ;’ Aen. 3, 7, etc.).

magistratus, etc. ἐς τὴν οἰκίαν αὖ·
τοῦ . . 1 ot ὲλλόἾιμοι καὶ οἱ ὕπατοι αὐτοὶ
&raray ὄρθρον συνεχῶς ἐφοίτων Dio, 57.
21, 4.

7. te invitum perrumpunt, ‘break
through your reserve against your will.'
The sense, as perhaps in 3. 15, 4, is a

metaphor from breaking into asoti-ress. and
much the same as that of ‘ quietem inrum·
Pere’ (e. 67, 1). The MS. ‘invite' hae ³3·
been corrected in the margin and in the ’ᾗ
old editions to ‘invito,’ which Nippae- ΞΞ
tains, taking ‘ perrumpunt’ to mean ‘ break ,ΤΞ
through this barrier,’ i.e. that inte Ξ
by the difference of rank between you ³,
and them. ³:

9. antisse . . . amicitiae. The acc. with
this verb is generally‘personal (cp. 347, 43 J‘
66, 5; 15. 50, 3; H. 1.87,4, etc.); sothai:
probably ⁴ amicitias ’ is best taken sor the
concrete ⁴ amicos‚’ as in Suet. Tib. 51‚ete.
The comparison intended is chiefly with
the friends of Augustus ,of equestrium
rank, as Maecenas, Crispus Sallustius.
Proculeius, etc.

non occulti ferunt, ‘openly main- g.
tain:' cp. ‘occulti’ 3. 29, 2, and the use
of ‘ serre' in 6. 26, 33 49, 3, etc. ”

10. at enim = ἀλλὰ γάρ, anticipating& ι
objection, and referring to c. 39. 5. ’ ⁷

12. in omnis ouras &meretum ξ
‘ had his attention distraeted between dl} .
kinds of care5,' i. e. had to look at dim-*js
culties on every side. ‘In‘ has the ἔοι-οῖ’,
of ‘ inter’ in 2. 67, 4, etc. ,

immensum, adv. as in c. 27, 3, εει·
He soresaw that his son-in-law would at· ,¹ .,
tain an enormous elevation, and might
hence think that he had better not be ᾖ
already too great. ,j

13. Ο. Proculeium: see Hor. od
2. 2, 5. Dio (54'. 3, 5) states that he wau!
brother of Varro Muraena (see on 1. ζ’
10, 3), and of Terentia, wife of Mae·
cenas, but the relationship is not clearly [53
made out:
