inexperta esse supplicia, nescia tributa 3 quae quoniam exuerint
inritusque discesserit ille inter numina dicatus Augustus, ille
delectus Tiberius, ne inperitum adulescentulum, ne seditiosum

1. egregium, etc. Tacitus seems here
to have in mind the passage of Verg.
Aen. 4. 93, etc.

2. sibi. On this dative, see Introd. v.
ξ 17: cp. ‘quibus . . . legiones procu-
buerint’ H. 4. 17, 6. On the three
legions, see Introd. vii. p. 103.

3. totidem legatos. Varus was him-
self the ‘legatus Augusti,’ but he is
separated from the legati in c. 61, 6, and
the context seems to show here that the
‘legati legionum' are meant. The fate
of a legatus named Numonius Vala is men-
tioned in Vell. 2. 119, 5.

4. palam. His attack, though by way
ofstratagem‚ is viewed as open war, com-
pared to the treason of Segestes.

5. bellum tractare: cp. 6. 44, 33 H.
4. 73, 4. A phrase formed on the analogy
of ‘ negotium tractare,’ etc.

7. sacerdotium hominum. The MS.
has ‘ sacerdotii-1 : hominum ' with ‘e’
written over ‘u :⁸ and it appears to be
considered that the colon is from the same
late hand as the ‘ e,’ and inserted to indi-
cate that ‘ hominem ' is to be taken with
the following words, and referred to
Segestes (see Pfitzner, p. 22). If we
suppostzthe prielsthlolcfid to (be to Augustu3,
oro iman us seee.57,2‚
‘sacerdotium hominum’ may well be a
contemptuous ‚expressiom like ‘ inter
ἲνῗιῗῒαῗὲἓῗὲἓέ »13εέἶέ Ἑᾷἲηῑῗῑὲεᾚῖῖ
other conjectures, see Baiter, and Halm,
Comm. Crit. That of ‘hostium ’ (Nipp.
from Halm, Ed. 1). and ‘hoc unum’
(Bezzenberger‚ retaining the colon of the
MS), seem the most felicitous.

Germanos numquam . .
saturos, etc.

. exou-
‘ True Germans could

never make sufficient apology to them-
selves, for that they have seen the fasces
and the toga between the Rhine and
Elbeff ‘Germanos ' is no doubt)1sed in
indignant contrast to Segestes, but to
supply ‘Segestem ’ with ‘ excusaturos’
seems beside the mark. The sentence
‘quod . . . viderint ’ describes the insig- ·
nia, notos Roman military invasion, but
rather of Roman mle, as they had seen it
before the defeat of Varus-»3 and Segestes
could hardly be regarded as the cause of
this. The thought is that the Germane.
could never forgive themselves for ha ⁸
allowed Roman dominion to exist at
among them, and would now be doubly
culpable to suffer its restoration.

9. aliis gentibus, etc„ i.e. those who
knew it not might think it good for
them ; those who have felt it and east it
off, should not now sear enemioe less
formidable than those whom they baffled.
‘ Ignorantia ' is a causal abl.: cp. c. 57, 2.

10. neseis. This is passively used in
16. 14, 3, and in Plautus: cp. 'gnarus,’
‘ignarus ’ c. 5, 4, ete.

ιι. dicatus. ‘Dico' appears tobevery
rarely (as Pl. Pan. 11), ⁴ dedico’ not
frequently, used, of consecration or deifi-
cation os persons.

12. delectus. Nipp. appears rightly to
see in this an ironical allusion to him-as
professedly the princeps of the state’s
free choice (c. 7, 10). The explanation
‘ chosen for this war‚’ like ‘Titus
domandae Iudaeae delectus' (H. 5. 1, 1),
would have no special significance here.

adulescentulum. It has been noted
that the age of Arminius (2. 88, 4) was
very nearly the same as that of Ger-
manlcus.
