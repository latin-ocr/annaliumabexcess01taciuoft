CORNELII TACITI ANNAL'IUM [A.U.C.775.

Scipio legatus praefuit qua praedatio in Leptitanos et 'suffugia
Garamantum3 alio latere, ne Cirtensium pagi impune trahe-

lectis, castella et munitiones idoneis locis inponens, dux ipse

pars aliqua militis Romani in ore in latere et saepe a tergo erat3

multique eo modo caesi aut circumventi.

citum pluris in manus dispergit praeponitque centuriones virtutis

nec, ut mos fuerat, acta aestate retrahit copias aut in 5

dispositis castellis per expeditos et solitudinum gnaros mutantem

gressus est, properantius tamen quam ex utilitate sociorum,

relictis per quos resurgeret bellum.

1'. Leptitanos. Leptis minor (Lamta
or Lamba), a free city between Thapsus
and Hadrumetum, is here meant; Leptis
maior (Lebdah) being east of Tripoli, and
beyond what can reasonably be supposed
to be the field of operations.

suffugia Garamantum, ‘places of
retreat among the Garamantes' (cp. 4.
47, 2 ; G. 16, 4, etc.): the word is used
in post-Augustan prose and in Ovid. The
Garamantes are generally placed in Fez-
zan, which is certainly sar nearer Leptis
‘ maior ’ than ‘ minor,’ but they may have
extended further westward.

2. cirtensium, Cirta, the chief town
of Numidia or New Africa, restored by
Constantine under his own name; which
is still borne by the modern city, the

capital of the French province.
“ traherentur, ‘should be plundered:’
cp. ‘Aeduorum pagos trahebat ' H. 2. 61,
2. The use appears taken stom Sall.
{letter of Lgthridates) H. 4. 61, 17 D, 19

5. quoquo inclinarent, subjunct. ex-
pressing frequent occurrence} ep. Introd.
v. 5 52.

6. in ore= ‘in conspectu : ' cp. ‘in ore
vulgi' H. 3. 36, 1.

10. veteris, Africa proper as distinct
from Numidia, now held with it: cp. note
on π. 52, 1.

ut‘ in limine belli, ‘as being close
to the seat of war:’ cp. ‘ut in civili beuo’

H. 2. 34, 1 ; and other such causal uses
of ‘ut,‘ given in Introd. v. ξ 67. There

seems to be no sufficient reason for omit· ἓ

ting it (with Nipp.).

11. mutantem mapalia3 adapted‚ like
‘positis mapalibus' (4. 2 5, 1), from terms
used of a camp.
lia’ are mentioned by Livy (29. 31) and

described by Vergil (G. 3, 331-334)‚ and, Ε
according to Shaw (Travels, i. p. 397). ,ε
answer to the ‘hhymas‘ or ‘beet-el—shar’ ,ξ

(‘houses of hair '), the goatskin tents, in

shape like an inverted boat, of the Bedo- '³
weens. Sallust, who thus describes their
shape (Jug. 18, 8). calls them ‘aedificiae’ap ·'

parently consounding them with such huts ’Δ
as are spoken of (‘arundine texta storea- .
que . . . tecta ’) in Liv. 30. 3, 9; which ,
according to Shaw (p. 400) answer to the ’
‘gurbies‘ (of hurdles daubed wilh mud ’
or of sunbaked clay and thatch) used by
the Kabyles; supposed by him to be the
‘ magalia ’ of Vergil (Aen. 1, 421). Both <
words are used sor the single tent or hut, ,
and for collections of them (the ‘douwars' ‚
of the former, ‘dashkrahs' of the latter
