written in the MS„ and the orthography
is confirmed by inscriptions (e. g. Orell-
3308, 3838, etc.). Nipp. notes that the
clause ‚‘ qui . . . accolunt’ is added to
distinguish it from Regium Lepidi (Reg-
gio), between Parma and Modena. Banish-
ment often took the form of restrictiori to
a town: cp. 13. 47, 4.

1. fuerat in matrimonio, ete. On
her marriage to Tiberius, his retirement
to Rhodes, and the death of her sons, see
Introd. viii. pp. 113, 114.

2. inparem, ‘beneath her: ' so‘ ma-
ternum genus impar '.(H 2. 50, 1). Cp.
Sall. Jug. 11, 3; Liv. 6. 34, 9. In family,
Tiberius was far above her former hus-
band, Agrippa, but had hardly as good a
position in the state; and her sons, as
adopted into the house of the Caesars,
and heim-designate of Augustus, would
rank above her husband.

3. tam intima, ‘so real? ‘Tam‘ is
used to add force to a superlative by Cic„
as ‘tam gravissimis iudiciis‘ (Phil. 12.

' 5, 11) and‘ tam maxime '(de Am. ²3)-

5. egenam. Livy, in a poetical pas-
sage (9 6, 41, adopts the Vergilian‘ om-
nium egeni '(Aen. 1. 599l; and Tacitus
uses this poetical word witl'1 genit. (as 4.
30, 2, etc.), or abl. (as 12. 46, 2).

inopia ao tabe longa, ‘by privation
and slow decay,’ i. e. ‘ tabe per inopiam
facta.’ Suetonius (Tib. 50) says that

‘ after the death of Augustus Tiberius

aggravated her restrictions, and withdrew
her ‘ peculium’ and annual allowance.
Th0ugh she died within the year her
rivations may thus have lasted three or
our months.
6. longinquitate, ‘ duration,’ She had

been sorgotten so long that none would
ask how she died. This sense of the word
is fully supported from the best authors
(cp. ‘longinquitas morbi ’ Cic. Phil. 10.
8‚16); and Ritter's reference to 6.14, 4
hardly yproves that any place within Italy
could be called‘ distant?

7. sempronium Gracchum. Thereis ’

evidence (Eckhel, v. 3043 C. 1. L. vi. 1,
1515 ’l that his praenomen was‘ Tiberius ⁸
and that he had been‘ iii vir monetalis’
and‘ quaest. designs' and Nipp. suggests
that he may be the same who is men-
tioned as a ytragedian by Ovid (ex P. 4.
16, 31), and of whom three or four lines
and titles are preserved by Priscian and.
others (Ribbeck, p. 1962.

8. prave facundusst of unscrupulous
eloquence. ’ cp. ‘pudens prave’ (‘ with
false modesty' ) Hor. A. P. 88.

9. temeraverat. This poetieal word
is also brought into prose by Livy (26.
13,13etc.;) it is generally figurative m
Tacitus, as c. 30, 3, etc.

10. contumacia et odiis, ‘through
defiance and antipathy,' i. e. by rous. ng
these feelings in her. Nipp. compares

ira magis quam metu. .acoenderant’
(15· 4 4)

12. scripsit. This is a mere aorist,
denoting a past event, as ‘inposuit' (6.
31, 2), ‘patefecit' (11 9, 4). etc.. whereas

‘credebantur’ expresses the belief at the
time when the letters were written.

13. Cercinam, the “ Karkenah' or ‘ Ker-
kena ' islands, in the Lesser Syrtis.

quattuordecim annis. On this ab·
lative, see Introd. v. ξ 26. As this
computation would make his exile date
from a year later than that of Julia‚ Nipp.
