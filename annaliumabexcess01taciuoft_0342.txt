If it be taken to mean those of that age
in all Egypt, it may be compared with
other estimates of the population‚ on
which see Mr. Donne, in Dict. of Geog.
p. 38. Hdt. (2. 165, 166) reckons the
Egyptian force (i.e. that of its military
caste) at a maximum of about 400‚ooo.

1. Rhamsen. Rameses Π. or Rameses
Meriamen (⁴ beloved of Ammon '), the
great king of the nineteenth dynasty, in the
fifteenth and fourteenth centuriesss. c. The
conquests ascribed to him here and in the
monuments are those assigned to Sesos-
tris by Hdt. (2. 102) and others, includ—
ing even Strabo (15. 1, 6, 686; 17. 1, 5,
789). He is the king represented in the
great colossi at Abu-Simbel.

Libya. This, as in Hdt. and else-
where, denotes the north coast of Africa ;
and ‘Aethiopia' especially Nubia and
Abyssinia. The monuments appear to
confirm this claim of conquest as regards

⁴ these countries and Syria and Mesopo-

tamia. Hdt. (z. 102-106) follows a
tradition nearly agreeing with that here

'ven, and includes Thrace as well as
{hythia in the list of Egyptian conquests.
On the monumental evidence, see Rawlin-
son, Egypt, ii. p. 302, etc.

2. Medisque . . . et Bactriano. The
expressions are changed from names of
countries to names of people, plural to

, singular, and again to plural, to avoid the

monotony of a long list: so ‘Samnis
Pelignus et Marsi' H. 3. 59, 23 and other
instanees given in Introd. v. ξ 2; Dr.
Synt. und Stil. ξ 5.

4. Bithynum . . . Lycium mare. The
former of these would appear to be taken
to mean the Euxine and Propontis, the

latter the northern part of the Levant.

The whole expression would include Asia
Minor, but not Thrace, in the conquests

of Rameses.

7. utensilium: cp. 1. 70, 6. Com
would not here be excepted from the
term, but rather mentioned for promin-
enee.

8. vi Parthorum. This appears here
invidiously contrasted with ¹ potentia ’
Romana,’ though ‘ vis Romana ‘ is used of ·
the Roman govemment in 3. 60, 6.

1 1 . Memnonis saxea effigies. One of two
sitting colossi ofAmunoph 111. (eighteenth ’
dynasty), still remainingamong the ruins of
Thebes, had been partially overthrown'by
an earthquake (probably in 728, Β. c. 26) ς
and the sound proceeding at sunrise from
its remaining part is first mentioned by ,;
Strabo (17. 1‚46‚ p. 816), and described„ ⁴
ψόφος ὼε ἂν πληγῆς οὗ μεγαλῆς. Pausanias -j
(1. 4²· 3) describes it as like the break- .-
ing of a harp-string. The Greek belief, j
that the statue was that of Memnon, ’ἡ
appears to have arisen between-the time of ¹
Strabo and that of Pliny (N. H. 36. 7, 11, ¹
58). A number os inscriptions, datin} 2
A. n. 65—196‚ are wn'tten on the legs an ³
base, by persons who heard the sound3 5
among them by Hadrian and Sabina. See ἔ
C. 1. G. 4719-4761 ; and Add. iii. p. 1200. v}
fou. ; C. I. L. iii. 1, 30-66: specimens L?-
of these are given in Wilmanns 2731- ’Ξ
27333 Orelli 517—5243 Henzen 5304-
5306, 6864. From a comparison οῖ i
similar sounds heard now in the buildings ‘i
of Thebes and elsewhere, it is suggested ³}
that these may have been due to the ’,ἕ
effect of a sudden increase os heat on the '⁵
chilled air in crevices. ΤῙῙε cessationi οἰ Ξ
the sounds since the restoration of the Ἀ
statue (probably by Septimius herus) ³·
and consequent alteration of its structure, ξ
confirms this. For the literature of the ’
subject, see Mommsen on C.1.L. 1.1.‚ Ξ
and Prof. Mayor on Juv. 15, 5. 1
