22. Per idem tempus Plautius Silvanus praetor incertis causis 1
Aproniam coniugem in praeceps iecit, tractusque ad Caesarem
ab L. Apronio socero turbata mente respondit, tamquam ipse
somno gravis atque eo ignarus, et uxor sponte mortem sump-

sisset. non cunctanter Tiberius pergit in domum, visit cubiculum, Β,
in quo reluctantis et impulsae vestigia cernebantur. refert ad 8³

senatum, datisque iudicibus Urgulania Silvani avia pugionem

and as a speaker of much genius and ele·
gance, but apt to sacrifice weight to viru-
lence (Dial. 26, 4; Quint. 10. 1, 116).
M . Seneca (Exc. Contr. 3, praef. 1-8) gives
a full description of his style.

1'. per immodicas inimicitias, ‘by
unrestrained aggressivenessz' cp. ‘facilis
caffizetriidizgrtiliarrzffgtiis’ 5. 11, 1. 7

: see on 1. .
Probably many senators and their sarssiligs
had personally suffered from him (cp. 1.
72. 4 .

Cretam amoveretur. This was
evidently only a ‘relegatio,‘ as he was not
deprived of his property, the present sen-
tence being one of full exile and deporta-
tion.

3. advertit, ‘ drew on himself: ' the
accusative is analogous to the personal
accigsative with this verb (1.41, 1 ; 2. 17,
2: . 4 ‚ 1).

interliioto igni atque aqua: cp.

6. 30, 1. N ipp. takes the latter ablatives‘

as depending on ‘interdicto,‘ which is
itself abl. abs, like ‘libero’ (3. 60, 6).
But the simpler construction is possible
and preferable: cp. ‘interdicta voluptas'
Hor. Ep. 1. 6, 64.

saxo Seripho. On the abl„ cp. ¹ Delo ’
3. 61, 1. On Seripho, see 2. 85, 4: here
it is contemptuously called a mere rock.

4. consenuit.. According to Jerome
on Eus. Chron. (Op. viii. p. 574, Migne),
he died there in the utmost want in 787,
Α. D. 34, the twenty-fifth year of his exile.
There is some reason, however, to sus-
pect the correctness of the date (see on
1.- 7²2 4)·

5. praetor. According to an inscrip-
tion cited by Nipp. (Bull. Arch. 1869. p.
isaii& sslzssg‘ffifliizzlfis’ ἑῗὲξςιῗξ
Frugi (cp. c. 62, 1).

6. in praeceps, i.e. from the uppet
story, by the window or stairs : cp. 6. 49,
1 . Quintilian (7. 2, ²4) records a similar
question in the trial osone Naevius, ‘prae-
cipitata esset ab eo uxor, an se ipsa sua
sponte iecisset?

ad Caesarem. It is to be observed
that Caesar takes a similar course to that
in Piso's case (3. 10, 6), by ‘ remitting' the
case to the senate, after some preliminary
investigation. .

7. L. Apronio: cp. 1. 56. 1, etc.

tamquam ipse, sc. ‘suissetz’
Introd. v. 5 39 b.

8. sumpsisset: cp. 3. 7 2.

10. impulsae, ‘ thrown by violence?

11. datis iudicibus. Nipp. (on 2. 79,
2) takes this to mean that the senate ap·
pointed a judicia] committee from its own
members.
they referred the mse to the ordinary
law-comm, which, as implied in 2 79. 23
3. 12, 10, had proper jurisdiction in
such a case. At a later time we find
ordinary criminal offences of this kind
tried before the full senate (13. 44, 9;

H 4- 44, 3)-

cp.

But it may also mean that

Silvani avia. The relationship is
fully discussed by Borghesi (OEuvres, v. Ᾰ-

308) and Ni

pp. This Silvanus was prob·

ably eldest son of M. Plautius, M. f. A. n. 3

Silvanus, cos. 752, Rc. 2, and subsequently

⁴ triumphalis' (Dio, 56. 12, 2 ; Inscr. Orell.
62 2); who might well have been son of
Urgulania (inserred from her friendship

with Augusta to have been of considerable j Ἰ

age). lt is· also probable that P. Plautius
Pulcher, quaestor in 784, A. D. 31 (laser.
Orell. 723), A. Plautius (13. 22. 3), Q.
Plautius (6. 40, 1), and Ti. Plautius Sil-
vanus Aelianus (H. 4. 53, 3) were his
brothers, and Plautia Urgulanilla (Suet.
Cl. 26, 27) his sister.
