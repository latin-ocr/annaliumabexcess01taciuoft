1. Taurus Statilius. Dio (54. 19, 6)
speaks of him as appointed in 738, B.C.
16, τὸ ἄστυ μετὰ τῆς ἄλλης Ἰταλίας
διοικεΐν; but this vicegerency‚ resemb-
ling that of Maecenas and Agrippa, may,
as Borghesi thinks (v. 317), have been
an extension os the praefecture‚ which he
may have held from the resignation of
Corvinus.

proveeta aetate: having been cos.
suff. in 717, B. e. 37, and not being likely,
as a ‘ novus hom0,' to have attained that
rank early in life, he may probably have
been born as early as 674, Β. c. 80. The
date of his death is not known, but we
can hardly place it as late as the appoint-
ment of Piso; so that other names must
have intervened. or the office must have
been in abeyance. On the descendants
gf Taurus, see 2. 1, 1; 12. 59, 13 15.

toleravit, ‘sustained its duties:’ so
with ‘munia' 13. 35, 2.

2. viginti per annos. Ι have not
followed Halm. and N ipp. here in alter-
ing the MS. text to ‘ quindecim‚' to bring
Tacitus into agreement with the untrust-
worthy story in Suet. Tib. 42 (see Introd.
iv. p. 24), and with the assumption that
the office was vacant at the death of
Augustus (see on 1. 7, 3). Another
view (see Pfitzner, p. 170, sqq) would
read ‘sex’ (on the supposition that ‘vi ’
had been altered to ‘viginti'), to bring
the passage into agreement with Seneca
(Ep. 83, 14), whose words have been
taken to date the appointment from the
departure of Tiberius to Campania (see
4. 57, 1). We should suppose that the
praefect's office in some form was per-
manent,- at least as early as the existence
of permanent urban cohorts; but probably
many of his functions were in abeyance

publico funere: see 3. 48, 1.

4. Quintiliano. Nipp. notes the pos- ¹

sibility of his identity with one Nonius
Quintilianus, cos. suff. in 792, A.1>. 39.

he is called below ‘scientiae caerimonia-
rcrlimctluie vektlns ' (setehInErod‘. ii.. p. 9). N ipp.

quindecimvirum, partitive

used where the ab1. with ‘e’ womffl J

recipi. An infin. is thus coordinated ,

with a noun in 4. 3, 1.

6. senatus consultum postulaverat. ³
He himself would not have had ‘ius re· ²
lationis‚’ and could only draw attention
to the subject ‘per egressionem' (see on ’
2. 38, 3). Such a decree was required for J
the promulgation of a Sibylline prophecy ³
(Dio, 39. 15, 3), and no doubt also for iu f

reeeption into the canon.

diadys. On the gen. after ‘vetus‚’ c . c. ζ

it occurs only in Sil. 4. 532 ; 17, 297.

incerto auctore, ‘on untmstworthy ⁷
while Augustus or Tiberius remained in information ;’ without having obtained

it from any one of reputation.
