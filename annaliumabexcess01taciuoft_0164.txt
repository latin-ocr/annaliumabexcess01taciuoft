146 INTRODUCTION.

One of them appears to have been called Tiberius,-another Gaius (Insc.
Orell. 668, 669, 670). It is also stated by M. Seneca (Controv. 4) that
Quintilius Varus (see on 4. 66, ι) was a son—in-law of Germanicus ; but
it is not known how this was the case. On the probable birth of another
child, see note on 1. 44, 2.

17. Α (26). A marriage had been projected in 715, 13.c. 39, between
Marcellus and the daughter of Sex. Pompeius. His marriage with Julia
daughter of Augustus took place in 729, 13.c. 25 (Dio, 53. 27, 5), in which
year Plutarch states (Ant. 87) that Augustus also adopted him ; but this
statement appears to require confirmation. He had been admitted to
the senate with praetorian rank 3 but his first and only actual magistracy
was the curule aedileship‚ held in his twentieth year, which was also the
year of his death. See 1. 3, 1 3 Propert. 3. 18, 13-203 Verg. Aen. 6.
861-884.

18. A (27). It is known that there were two ‘ Marcellae ¹ (Suet. Aug.
63; Insc. Henzen 5373, 5374) and that one of them, generally taken to
be Marcella minor, was married to Agrippa (see note 5) and to Iulus
Antonius (see note on 4. 44, 5). That the other was married to M.
Valerius Barbatus Appianus and to Sex. Appuleius, is a supposition to
explain the relationships mentioned in 4. 52, 1; 2. 50, ις where see
notes. Nothing appears to be known of the date of birth or death of
either sister.

19. A (28). Suetonius states (Aug. 63) that Agrippa had children by
Marcella. That one of these was a daughter, probably another Vipsania,
and was married to Q. Haterius, is an inference from the name of
Haterius Agrippa, and from the mention made (2. 51, 2) of his relation·
ship to Germanicus.

20. Α (29). Tacitus twice (4. 44, 3 ; 12. 64, 4) speaks of the wife of
Domitius as ‘Antonia minor 3' but Suetonius (Cal. 1; Ner. 5) appears
to be right in assigning this marriage to Antonia maior, and in making
Antonia minor the wife of Drusus. The marriage with Domitius (on
whom see 4. 44, 3 ; Suet. Ner. 4) is said to have been projected as early
as 717, Β. c. 37 (Dio, 48. 54, 4); at which time it would appear from
dates furnished by Plutarch (Ant. 33, 93o; 35, 931) that the elder
Antonia was but a'n infant, and the yotmger yet unborn.

21. A (30). Antonia received the title of Augusta on the accession of

’ her grandson Gaius to the principate (Dio, 59. 3, 63 Orell. Insc. 649, 2
650, 678, etc.) 3 but soon after died, or was put to death. We hear of a ·

temple erected to her, probably by Claudius (Pl. N. H. 35. 10, 36, 94);

and a basilica at Rome appears to have borne the name of both sisters, ι,

‘Basilica Antoniarum duarum’ (Henzen 7263).
