148 INTRODUCTION.

her husband's lifetime she was entitled ‘Livia Augusti dea' in·an in-
scription in Sicily (Orell. 614), and at other times received abroad other
titles not formally allowed (see notes on 1. 14, 1); and her birthday
was kept after her death (see 6. 5, 1).

27. On the parentage of Vipsania (who is called simply ‘Agrippina’
in Suet. Tib. 7; Insc. Orell. 658), see note 4. She was betrothed to
Tiberius Nero in infancy (⁴ vix annicula' Nep. Att. 19), but the date of
their marriage is not known. On the distress of Tiberius at being forced
to divorce her and to marry Julia‚ see viii. p. 113; on her subsequent
marriage to C. Asinius Gallus Saloninus, see 1. 12, 6; and on her
death, 3. 19, 4. She had several children by her second marriage, for
whom see on 3. 75, 1; 4. 1, 1; 34, 13 6. 23, 3.

28. B (2). Tiberius down to the time of his adoption bears the name
‘Ti. Claudius Ti. F. Nero,' his titles being those of his two consulates,
with those of pontifex and imperator, and, after 748, B.c. 6, the years
of tribunitian power, see Insc. Henzen 5375. After his adoption he
becomes ‘Tiberius Caesar, Augusti f., Divi nepos' (Insc. Orell. 683),
but usually drops the gentile name Julius. During his principate, the
name Augustus, though not allowed by him in ordinary use (Suet. Tib.
263 Dio, 57. 2), always appears on coins and inscriptions. The ‘prae-
nomen imperatoris' was not adopted, though found sometimes in pro-
vincial inscriptions (see C. 1. L. viii. 2, Index, p. 1038). The years of
his tribunitian power continue to be reckoned‚ inclusive of those which
he shared with Augustus ς, and the number of times on which he was
saluted imperator (see on 2. 18, 2) are added. Hence his mortuary
inscription (Orell. 691) runs thus: ‘ Ossa Ti. Caesaris Divi Aug. F. Aug.
Pont. Max. Trib. Pot. xxxiix. Imp. viii. Cos. V.'

29. Β (3), Neither Drusus nor his second son were ever adopted
into the family of the Caesars. In life, Drusus was entitled augur, consul
(745, 13.c. 9), and imperator: after his death the surname ‘Germanicus’
was conferred on him and his family. Suet. Cl. 13 cp. Henzen 5375.
His eldest son was thus entitled to bear the name, before his own
achievements in Gerrnany, and on his adoption into the family of the
Caesars in 757, ΑΛ). 4, his brother assumed it (Suet. Cl. 2) as repre·
sentative of his father’s house.

30. B (4). Drusus Caesar bears the titles of augur, pontifex, quaestor, ἢ

sodalis Augustalis (see 1. 54, 2), flamen Augustalis (see on 2. 83, 2),
Cos. ii (768, 774, A». 15, 21), trib. pot. ii (see on 3. 56, 1), xv vir
sacris faciundis, Orelli 211, 652. For the grounds on which the date
of his birth is assigned, see note on 3. 56, 75 for the honours awarded

at his death, see notes on 4. 9, 2.
