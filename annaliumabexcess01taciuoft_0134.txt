116 INTRODUCTION.

must be ripe in years and tried in service, prominent enough to be such
as a free state might be supposed to choose. Again, the precariousness
of his own health obliged Augustus always to contemplate the possibility
of a speedy as well as a distant succession. Hence it was always his
policy to surround his throne with props¹, and to have different heirs in
various grades of expectancy. In the first rank were his nearest relatives,
to be his choice if time allowed him to make them sufficiently prominent.
Such in the earlier years was Marcellus, and such in later times were
Gaius and Lucius Caesar. Secondly, there must be another in reserve,
already ripe in years and tried in real life, who might fill the chief place
in case of a sudden vacancy 3 but who, after a sacrifice of the best years
of his life for the ruling house, might expect to be summarily set aside
for a youth, if circumstances hereafter made it feasible. Such in the
earlier years was Agrippa, and such was in later times the position of
Tiberius. Each was victim ·in turn to the matrimonial arrangements
which Augustus always carried out with more than a Roman's disregard
of natural affection, often with a cynical contempt even for common
decency ². Each had endeavoured to escape from an intolerable position
by retirement from Rome ³. Agrippa, had he lived long enough, would
probably again have had to retire before his own sons, adopted into the
family of the Caesars over his head. Tiberius, even at the death of Gaius,
had Germanicus been ten years older or Augustus ten years younger,
would probably have been again postponed to the grandson of Octavia,
whose children by Agrippina would still more nearly represent the true
blood of Augustus ⁴.

We may well believe that a sense of public ⁶ duty cooperated with the
solicitations of Livia, in procuring the adoption of her son, which she so
often recalled to him in after times as the crowning service of her life ⁶.
Still, with the tenacity that marked all his policy, Augustus seemed even
then to leave a chance open for future family schemes, not only by him-
self adopting at the same time the worthless Agrippa Postumus ⁷, but
also by compelling Tiberim, as the price of his own adoption, to adopt
