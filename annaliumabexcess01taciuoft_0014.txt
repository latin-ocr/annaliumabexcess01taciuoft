by him, but also by permission given to study and use
the materials collected by him for lectures given on these
Books of Tacitus during his tenure of the Corpus Pro-
fessorship of Latin, which have been most helpful on a
number of points of scholarship throughout the volume.
Classical authors are mostly cited from the texts of
the Teubner series; and it is hoped that the abbrevia-
tions used in referring to them, and-to editors or other
modern writers, will generally explain themselves. As
regards Latin inscriptionS‚ the ‘Monumentum Ancy-
ranum' (Mon. Anc.) is cited from Mommsen’s edition

dey’s Appendix to Annals‚ vol. ii.; most others from
the collection of Orelli and Henzen or that of Wilmanns;

the Ephemeris Epigraphica (Eph. Epig.) 3 any others
given are usually cited at secondhand. In numismatics
references are made to Eckhel (‘ doctrina numorum
veterum ') and to Cohen (‘ Medailles Imperiales‚’ 2nd ed.,
1879); on other works of art, mostly to the ⁴ Iconographie
Romaine' of Visconti and Mongez; on questions of
Roman topography‚ mostly to Mr. Burn (‘ Rome and the
Campagna’). In references to Dr. Smith's Dictionaries,
'the authors of the articles are in most cases cited by
name; on questions of general Latin Lexicography it is
to be understood that the Latin Dictionary of Messrs.
Lewis and Short is usually referred to.

It hardly needs to be said that, out of the large
number of references given, whether to ancient authors,
to inscriptions, or to modern works, a vast majoth had
been already given in previous editions or lexicons, and
are due to no research on my part. I may, however, say
