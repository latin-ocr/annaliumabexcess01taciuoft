540 APPENDIX III.

Tiberius ¹ ς who was nevertheless obliged to proceed with ¹the utmost
caution, as he was unable to reckon on the fidelity of the praetoriam.
A man of determined loyalty was secured for the consulship in the person

of Memmius Regulus ², and almost immediately afterwards the blow &as
struck.

The 18th of October* is marked as the day on which the famous
meeting of the senate took place in the Palatine Temple, at which the
‘long wordy letter from Capreae ' was read. Naevius Sertorius Macro
had brought with him, together with this missive, his own appointment
to the command of the praetorians, in which the soldiers were induced
by a liberal bribe to acquiesce. The ‘ vigiles,’ over whom Seianus had
no influence‚ guarded the senate under their praefect Graecinus Laco, and
led Seianus to the dungeon where he was on the same day exeeuted ⁴.
By subsequent sentences perished his eldest son ⁵, his uncle Junius
Blaesus ⁶, and others⁷; while many more were thrown into prison to
await trial.

Tiberius, who had awaited news of these proceedings in extreme
anxiety ⁸, was soon afterwards filled with horror and indignation‚ on a
statement being made by Apicata, the divorced wife of Seianus, respect-
ing the murder of Drusus, with the connivance of his adulterous wife,
eight years previously ⁹. Livilla was put to death, or more probably
compelled to commit suicide ¹⁰3 and further investigations, conducted with ἢ
the utmost atrocities of torture, took place before Tiberiushimself ¹¹. ,
