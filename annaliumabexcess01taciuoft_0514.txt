evidence as trivial (Pfitzner, p. 107). A
long list of enumerative asyndeta from
Tacitus is given here by Nipp.

1. vocentur, ‘are challenged to;’ like
‘ vocare in ius‚' etc.

locupletiores, ‘ more trustworthy 3’
a frequent sense in Cic. with ‘ auctor' or
‘ testis.’ -

2. potentia, ‘arbitrarily;' i. e. ‘be—

· cause he was master‘i’‘cp. ‘qui vi et po-

testate non iure et legibus cognoscunt'
(Dial. 19. 5); where the abl. appears to
partake both of instrumental and causal
cliaracter.
ex vero, ‘ from the truth of the
case)
· 3. Antigoni. Antigonus Doson occu-
( pied Sparta aster the victory of Sellasia
ἰ in B.c. 222 (Polyb. 2. 7o); Mummius had
arranged the affairs of Achaia after the

ll of Corinth in 608, B.c. 146.

4. permisso publice arbitri03 rightly
explained by Nipp. to mean ‘the arbitra-
tion having-been entrusted to their state ’
(cp. ‘ publice ’ c. 36, 2). Record of similar
awards is osten found ς and this particular
one was inscribed on the base of the statue
of Nike by Paeonios at Olympia, and is
given and explained by Mr. Hicks (Ma-
nual of Greek Inscriptions‚ No. 200), to
whom Ι am also indebted forits date as
probably that of the consulship of Q. Cal-
purnius Piso (A. U. C. 619, B.C. 135). The
awarding body was a panel of 600 dikasts ;
the majority (58 to 16) being such as to
justify Mr. Hicks inference that the case
was clear, and that the subsequent counter-
decision (see ξ i) was probably an in-
stance in which Antonius had traded on
the memoranda of Caesar. ⁴

Atidium Geminum. Borghesi (V.

was probably praetorian proconsul (see
on 1. 74, 1) at some time aster 725, B.c.

5. secundum Messenios datum, sc.
“iudicium ’ or ⁶ ius templi ς ’ the question

mooted at the beginning os the chapter. ᾗ
Boundary stones in accordanee with this Ξ
award, and apparently belonging to this

6. Segestani . . . montem apud Ery-
cum. Segesta (the Greek‘Eywv-a) and the ’
mountain of Eryx were both in the north· ἔ
west comer of Sicily 3 the latter being iden— ᾗ

pani (Drepanum), and the ruins of the
former traceable north-west os Calatafimi,
west of Alcamo. The city of Eryx on the ⁷
slope of the mountain appears to have ‘'
been deserted (Strab. 6. 2, o, 272), prob· ⁴
ably ever since its destruction by Hamil· ²,
car Barca in the first Punic war (Diod. ἶ
²3· 9 ; ²4· 8), and we gather here that ite*
territory had passed to the Segestans; but„
the temple on the summit had been of
old (Thuc. 6. 46¹ 3), and continued to be, ’ᾗ
very samous; and the goddess had also ἔ,
under this title a temple in Rome. The j
form ‘Erycus’ is found in Cic. Verr. π’. ”
