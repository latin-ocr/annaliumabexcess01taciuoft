9. A (10). Agrippa Postumus was adopted by Augustus at the same
time with Tiberius in 757, Ap. 4 3 and is styled ‘ Agrippa Caesar ' in an
inscription (Henzen 5378), and on a medal struck at Corinth, which
gives also his effigy (Cohen, i. p. 187). He was removed to Surrentum
(Suet. Aug. 65) about 760, Aa). 7, and thence to Planasia. On his
death, see 1. 6.

10. Α (12). It is generally supposed that the Silanus to whom Aemilia
Lepida was married was the consul of 772, Aa). 19, on whom see note
on 2. 59, 1. Pliny records (N. H. 7. 13, 11, 51) that their eldest son,
M. Silanus (on whom see note on 13. 1, 1), was born in the last year
of Augustus, who had thus lived to see his great-great-grandson. For
L. Silanus (20), see notes on 12. 3, 2 ; for D. Silanus (21), see on 12.
58, 1 3 for Junia Calvina (22), see on 12. 4, 1 ; for Junia Isspida (23),
see on 16. 8, 2. L. Silanus (on whom see 15. 52, 33 16. 7, 2), who,
like his uncle (21), bore the name of Torquatus (on which see 3. 69, 9),
appears to have been the last of this family, and, except Nero, the last
surviving male descendant of Augustus.

1 1'. A (1 3). Nero Caesar was born probably in the middle of 759, mn. 6,
(see Henzen, p. 60), and was betrothed in childhood to a daughter of
Creticus Silanus (2. 43, 3), and married to Julia in 773, Aa). 20, on his
entry into public life (3. 29, 4). Tacitus describes his character (4. 15;
59), the plots against him (4. 60; 67), and the formal charges brought
against him (5. 3). On these he was pronounced a public enemy (Suet.
Cal. 7), banished to Pontia, and subsequently put to death or compelled
to suicide (Suet. Tib. 54), shortly before the fall of Seianus. His titles
were those of flamen Augustalis, sodalis Augustalis, sodalis Titius, frater
arvalis, fetialis, quaestor. Insc. Orell. 2366.

Α.]>.7 (see Henzen‚p.6o). His entry into public life is mentioned in 4.4, 1;
his character in 4. 60, 5. He was also denounced as a public enemy
(Suet. Cal. 7), and imprisoned in the Palatium, where he died (6. 23, 4).
His marriage with Aemilia Lepida was mentioned in the lost part of
Book v. (see on 6.,40, 4). His titles are given as follows, praefectus urbi
(see 4. 36, 1), sodalis (or flamen) Augustalis (Insc. Orell. 667), and
‚ pontifex: Henzen 53863 C. Ι. L. iii. 1, 380.

13. A (1 5). Gaius Caesar, generally known by his nickname ‘Caligula'
(see 1. 41, 3), on the condemnation of his mother and brothers, passed
under the tutelage of Antonia, and afterwards lived with Tiberius at
Capreae: see 6. 20, 1 ; Suet. Cal. 10. He is styled at this time ‘ C. Caesar
