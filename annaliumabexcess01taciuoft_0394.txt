have been fifteen years, and that the.
words here may be a corruption os ⁴ post
quintum decimum repudi annum.’ During
the interval she had married Mamercus

Faustus Cornelius Sulla, son of the dic-
tator, had married the daughter of Cn.
Pompeius Magnus (cp. Bell. Afr. 95, 2).
Their daughter Cornelia was mother of
Lepida by Q. Aemilius Lepidus, cos. 773,
B.c. 21 (Dio, 54. 6, 3; Hor. Ep. 1. 20,
28), whose relationship to the main stem
of the Lepidi is uncertain.

1. defertur. On the inf. with this
verb, cp. 2. 27, 1.

2. 1². Quirinio: see c. 483 2. 30, 4.

⁷3. quaesitumque, etc. On the Chal-
daean astrologers, see 2. 27, 2. To consult
them against (or concerning) the imperial
family or on the future of the state was
made a capital offence, as any sinister
prediction was an encouragement to con-
spiracies. For similar charges, cp. 12.
22, 1 v; 16. 30, 2. It was still a capital
offence at the time of the jurists‚ as was
also, sor similar reasons. the enquiry by a
slave touching the horoscope of his
master: see the authorities cited in Mar-
quardt, Staatsv. iii. p. 91, 9²·

4. Manio Lepido: see note on c. 32,
23 1. 13, 2.

post dietum repudium, ‘after de-
claration of divoree 3' the usual phrase is
'mittere repudium! The vindictiveness

, of Quirinius appears to be sho'wn not so

much by the prosecution being mdrely
after a divorce, as by its being many
years after it. The statement of Suetonius
(Tib. 49) that twenty years had inter-
vened, seems exaggerated; as Quirinius
can hardly have married her till after the
death of L. Caesar in 755, A.D. 2 (cp. c. 2 3,
1) ; but Nipp. thinks that the interval may

of consulting astrologers respecting his

charge of adultery into one of treasou ξ

10. quae velut reicere voluerat, ‘what e*

he had apparently desired to exclude from

the case.' ‘ Reicere‚’ which had been cor· ,Ι
rected to ‘ reticere ' and “ reticeri: has got

back into most texts, except that of N ipp„ .
who reads ‘ nescire.⁹ We should certainly .
have rather expected ‘ velut reiecerat ⁹ or
‘velut reici voluerat ; ’ but no alteration
appears to be really necessary (sor further J
discussion, see Pfitzner, p. 160, 165 ; Joh. ἢ

Miiller, Beit. 3. p. 31). On the use of “

‘velut,‘ see 1. 8, 7. Tiberius had not pro·
hibited, nor, as it seemed, sincerely de·
precated the charge. ' ,

11. militari custodia: cp.14. 60, 53 -
H. 4. 11, 4. This custody would be that -
of the praetorians, who, though not yet ·
collected into their camp (4. 2, ι), must ’·
have had some barrack prison (ep. 1. 21, 2) .
in Rome. The change from this to the ,
custody of the consuls, who were now ,
civil magistrates only, would hardly, in y·
the case of slaves detained sor torture, Ι
arise from a desire to be lenient to them, ,·
but would be significant of Caesar's wish 5

to exercise no influence in the trIal.
