45 (51). Idem annus gravi igne urbem adficit, deusta parte]
circi, quae Aventino contigua, ipsoque Aventino; quod damnum

accus. agrees with the general usage of
Tacitus (Introd. v. ς 12 c) ; but he always
elsewhere uses this verb absolutely (as in
c. 42, 4, etc.) or with dat. (c. 33, 5), and
would more naturally have used such an
expression as ‘Seleuciam propinquabat ’
(cp. 12. 13, 1), than the MS. text.

1. fama atque ipso, ‘the news and
‚le ato
atque ipse. .subegit'(14. 20‚1).Ngipp.
notes instances in which such an abl. is
used without a preposition, where not
strictly a person, but the fact of the pre-
sence of a person, is meant: as ‘repentinis
hostibus circumventi' (15. 4 4).

2. distrahi. On the historicinf. with
a6temporal conjunction, see Introd. v. ξ
bellum. .tra0taret: cp. 1. 59, 4.

3. festinati casus, ‘a speedy crisis?

4. disiectos: cp. 1. 32, 7.

ne animo quidem, ‘not even in wi113'
still less' m readiness to act.

7. amne, the ·Ti gris, which he had
crossed to Ctesiphongn (c. 4²· 6).

8. Elymaeis. The best. known peo-
ple of this name lived on the coast at the
'head of the Persian Gulf: Polybius (5.
44, 9) and Ptolemy (6. 2, 6) alsoy give the
name to a district or people of Media;
'neither of which positions could be‘ a
tergo? in the same sense as Armenia. It is
perhaps possible to take‘ a tergo ’of the
Elymaeans and other eastern tribes only,
and to understand that they were to be
got to harass the rear of Artabanus when

he should advance against Tiridates· but
much more probable that the geographi-
cal position of the Elymaei has been mis-
pnderstood by Tacitus or those whom he
ollowed

1 2. a gente Arabum. From the words
‘rex Arabum Acbarus‚' in 12. 12, 3, it
would appear that the people inhabiting
Edessa and its neighbourhood and the
country called by later writers Osrhoene
are here meant.

13. pudore . . . exsolvit, ‘deprived
their desertion of its disgrace! The
words are repeated from H. 3. 61, 4.
The subject of the Roman relations with
Parthia and Armenia is renewed by Taci-
tus in 11. 8, 1. Of the intermediate pe·
riod it is sufficient here to note that Mi-
thridates secured for himself the kingdom
of Armenia; that Artabanus reestablished
his authority in Parthia and made peace
with Vitellius, and aster experiendng
some further vicissitudes died in
sion in 793, A. D. 40 (see Prot. Garduer.
as cited on 2. 1,1),in which year the city
of Seleuceia successfully asserted its suli
independence (cp. 11. 9, y6). See Introd.
to vol. ii.

15. Idem annus . . . adficit: cp. 4.
15:1‹13i1sta parte circi: cp. ⁴ deusto

monte Caelio’ 4. 64, 1. The Circus Max-
imus lay in the valley between the Pala-
tine and Aventine. The great fire of
Nero also broke out in it (15. 38, 2); but ²
its chief force took the opposite direction,.'
