(α) The gem'tives mei, sui, etc„ are used srecly sbr tlte possessive pronaum,
mum aa usual restnztnvn to cases ef speum empnam (Madv. 29⁷ b,
Obs. 2), as nostri origine 2. 54, 3; sui incessu 4. 24, 2, etc. In this
· usage Tacitus is surpassed perhaps only by Apuleius. Dr. ξ 68 a.

’ (b) With verbs, such a gem'live is used, by Tacitus alone, with monere 1.
’ 67, 1 (asin classical prose with its compounds) ς with adipisci 3. 55, 1 ;
’ζ and apisci 6. 45, 6 (on the analogy os potiri). The use with egere (4. 2ο,
ζ. 4, etc.) and indigere (6. 46, 9, etc.) is more common. Dr. ξ 68 b.

(c) stelliptiml genitive, so constant with verbs of judging or amusing,

ἶἒ (d) With paritet‘ples. This usage is more common in Tacitus than in
” any os his predecessorS, though perhaps no participle is first so used by
ἶ, him. A list os thirteen is given by Dr. (ξ 7ο), many of which occur
s frequently, as cupiens r. 75, 4, etc. ς inpatiens 2. 64, 4, etc. ; intolerans
1. 31, 4, etc. ς retinens 2. 38, 9, etc.; sciens 1. 64, 6, etc. ς and others.

.- (e) With affectiva, also characteristic of Tacitus from its extreme
⁴ irequency. Dr. 5 71, Zumpt 437.

, (α) Expressing direct object, like the participles above (d), where
J a participle with accus. might be substituted (Roby 1312): as with sormi-
’ dolosior r. 62, 3; pavidus 4. 38, 1; praescius 6. 21, 5; providus, 4.
³ 38, 1, etc.

J (β) Expressing a remoter object, where the abl. with prep. would
’. be usual (Roby 1318): so ambiguus imperandi 1. 7, 4, exitii certus 1.
i 27, 3; ineerta ultionis 2. 75, 1 ; potentiae securus 3. 28, 33 and many
’ others.

. (γ) Expressing the thing in point ofwhich a term is applied to
ᾗ a person 3 an especially poetieal and Tacitean usage (Roby t 320). Α very
ε’. frequent example is the (perhaps) locative animi (Roby 1 168), as 1 . 32, 5 ;

i· {estus 2. 85, 3, etc.; melior 3. 74, 1 ; modicus 2. 73, 3 ; occultus 4. 7, 2 ;
-ῑ pervicax 4. 53, 1 3 praeclarus 4. 34, 4; praestantissimus 6. 6, 2; sper-
nendus 14. 4ο, 3 3 validus, 4. 21, 5; vetus 1. 2ο, 2 3 and others. Some·
j'} times two genitives are concisely used where accusatives with inter would
he expected, as with ambiguus 2. 24, 6 3 4ο, ²3 and trepidus 6. 21, 4.

34. 'l'he 0011111νο erqumty is used with the same brachylogy as the
