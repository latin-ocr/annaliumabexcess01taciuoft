cated from which the objection to the
loss of ‘patria potestas' over ‘ flamen '
and ‘flaminica’ proceeded, whether srom
possible candidates or their parents. The
passage in Livy (27. 8) would show the
office to have been rather a burden than
a privilege, as a person is ⁴ taken' sor it
against his will.

1. qui . . . apisceretur. Gaius (1, 130)
says, ‘exeunt liberi virilis sexus de patris
potestate, si flamines Diales inaugurentur,
et seminini sexus, si virgines Vestales
capiantur.' This was without ‘ capitis
diminutio,‘ such as would have been in-
volved in adoption into another family.
The ceremony of ‘taking' was a kind of
‘mancipatio‚' by which the person came
under the ‘ potestas’ of the deity, repre-
sented by the chief pontiff: see Mar-
quardt‚ Staatsv. iii. p. 30¹·

flamonium z so also in 13. 2, 6.

⁷ Mommsen (Eph. Epig. i. 222) notes that
the office of flamen is always in inscrip-
tions ‘flaminatus’ or ‘flamonium‚’ and
that the latter form is preserved by the
MSS. of Tacitus, of Cic. (Phil. 13. 19. 41),
and of Livy (26. 23).

quaeqlso . . . . conveniret. ⁸ Con-
ventio in manum‚’ whereby the husband
acquired a power analogous to that of a
father over his wife, though not essential
to marriage as such. was involved in the
ceremony of ‘confarreatio' or ‘coemptio,’
or the fact of a year's unbroken ‘ usus.'
A marriage of the latter kind would thus
always be ‘ sine conventione ’ during the
first year, and, ,even by old law, might
thus continue indefinitely‚ by annual sus-

sion of cohabitation for a ‘ trinoctium?

this and other ways marriages ‘ sine
conventione' had come to be the rule3 the
woman thus becoming ‘uxor tantummodo)
not ‘ mater familias’ (CicTop. 3, 14). By
the old law she gained thereby no freedom,
but remained in ‘potestate patris3' lat-
ter-ly, however. the ‘patria potestas’ had
become much relaxed, and women were
enabled, by legal fictions, to control their

own property through a ‘ procurator‚' and
acquire practica! independence (see Mar-
quardt, Privatl. i. p. 63). To this the
marriage of the ⁸ flaminica’ would be an
exception, being necessarily by ‘con-
farreati0,’ and therefore ⁴ cum eonven-
tione.’

2. senatus decreto aut lege. Nipp.
notes that ‘leges' still continue to be
distinctly mentioned (cp. 11. 13, ²3 H. 3. >
37, 33 4. 47, 2), and that several distinct
‘ leges' of this and later date are specified
by jurists‚ but that their enactment by
the comitia must have been ρ. mere
formality. It probably corresponded to ,
the formal ‘renuntiatio' of elections‚ or ’
the formal plebiscite by which the tri- .
bunitian power of the princeps was
ratified (Introd. vi. 7 3). Similar legisla-
tive enactments by ‘ senatus consulta ' are
mentioned in η. 7, 3; 60, 2.

3. quaedam . . . flexissetr see note
below (§ 5). It would also appear from ’
3. 71, 3, that Augustus had relaxed the ³
old rule preeluding the flamen from a
single night's absence: Gellius (l. l.) also ’
alludes to some relaxations without speci·
fying their date or nature.

5. demutari; apparently one os the g
words revived by Tacitus from Plautus. ‚'

6. sacrorum causa, etc. A defective
passage in Gaius (1, 136; see Marquardt, ᾗ
iii. 319, n. 9), alluding to this enactment, a}
