CORNELII TACITI ANNALIUM [A.U.C.785.

Q. Servaeus posthac et Minucius Thermus· inducti, Servaeusss
praetura functus et quondam Germanici comes, Minucius equestri
loeo, modeste habita Seiani amicitia; unde illis maior miseratio,
contra Tiberius praecipuos ad scelera increpans admonuit C.8

5 Cestium patrem dicere, senatui quae sibi scripsisset, suscepitque
Cestius accusationem. quod maxime exitiabile tulere illa tem· 4
pora, cum primores senatus infimas etiarn delationes exercerent,
alii propalam, multi per occultum3 neque discerneres alienos
a coniunctis, amicos ab ignotis, quid repens aut vetustate ob-

10 scurum: perinde in foro, in convivio, quaqua de re locuti incu-

s sabantur, ut quis praevenire et reum destinare properat, pars ad ’

subsidium sui, ¹plures infecti quasi valetudine et contactu· sed δ”
Minucius et Servaeus damnati indicibus accessere.

worthily avenged.⁷ We should infer that
the penalty was exile.

1. Q.. Servaeus: see 2. 56, 5; 3. 13.
3; 19, 1. Minucius Thermus may have
been the father of the person mentioned
in 16. 20, 2.

inducti, were brought into court:
cp. ⁴ reus capitis inducor’ Appul. Met. 3.
7, 18⁵·

3. modeste habita: cp. 4. 44, 1. The
words apply to both the persons.

4. praecipuos . . . increpans, ‘ de-
nouncing them as foremost in crime ε ’ cp.
‘praecipuum ad pericula' ¹4- 58, 1.

Ο. Cestium patrem: see on 3. 36,
2 ; here so called to distinguish him from
his son (see on 15. 25, 5); unless ‘prae-
torem ’ should be read, with Lips. Neither
should be identified (as by Ritt.) with the
professional rhetor Cestius often cjteu by
M. Seneca. The well-known pyramid of
C. Cestius at Rome records some member
of this family who was trib. pl„ praetor,
and ‘ septemvir epulonum,' about the
middle of the pnncipate of Aug-ustus
(Burn, p. 209); another may have given
hia name66t)o the original ‘pdns Cestius·

( admonuit. This verb takes an inf.
in Agr. 25, 3; also in Augustan poets and
Liv.: so ‘monere’ 11. 1, 2, ete.

6. exitiabile: so used in c. 24, 1 3 15.
44. 4, etc.; and ‘exitiosus’ more frequent-
ly. Both words are rare, but classical.

9. repens, used in the sense of ‘recens‘

   
      
   
  
    
   
      

often by Tacitus (11. 24, 73 15. 68, 53 '
H. 1. 23, 1; 4. 25, ι), and by no other ζ
author. ¹
10. in foro, etc.: ‘locuti’ is supplied ‘³
with ‘in soro’ and ‘in convivio; and
¹ quaqua de re ’ applies to speech at both ’-
t6hese or any other places: see note on 4. s
, 2 Ni .).

14. Iulius Africanus; probably ἱιῇ
