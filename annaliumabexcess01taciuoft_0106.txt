imperial confidence after him, as Sallustius Crispus¹ and Seianus, and
many others who by filling such offices as the important ‘praefecturae'
in Rome ² and that of Egypt ⁸ ‘neld a position superior to most senators.
The equestrian order was thus a gainer by the revolution, both through
the relative depression of the order above them, and through the special
career of emolument and distinction held out to them ⁴. Throughout
the empire, their ‘societates' farmed the revenue⁶3 the residence of
senators in Rome left thern the aristocracy of municipal Italy and the
provinces; and many might pass from the lower to the higher rank of
their order by gaining the ‘knights' patent of nobility ⁶,¹—a procurator-
ship.

The resident senators and knights with their wives and children, and
many of the families of those absent on foreign service, formed an upper
population in Rome, variously estimated at from 10,000 to nearly 50‚ooo ⁷.
To these wealthy classes belonged most of the ‘domus' or palaces ⁸,
filling, with their gardens and grounds, so large a portion of the city ;
which, with the great addition made by Augustus to the public buildings
and‘open spaces, must have compressed into closer and closer quarters
the vast crowd occupying the chambers in the ‘insulae’ or blocks of
buildings, towering often seventy feet high ⁹, where the ‘ plebs ² found such
lodgings as they could afford, and, in the labyrinthine streets of ‘ vetus
Roma ’ before the fire of Nero ¹⁰, lived in probably even greater dis-
comfort than in the time of Juvenal ¹¹. The plebs, however, had its
many grades of position within its ranks. Many must have been only
barely below the equestrian census 1², and many others, if not, like the
senators and equites, great capitalists, must have earned in various ways
large incomes, in the thousand callings and trades of Rome. To this
class also belonged vast numbers, among freeborn or freedmen, of what
are now called the liberal professions. The schoolmaster, as Orbilius ¹³

be illustrated by the inscription to Va-
