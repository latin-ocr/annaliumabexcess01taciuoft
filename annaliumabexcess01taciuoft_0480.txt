mentioned in 2. 47, 1 ‚ it is associated with
the cities which suffered earthquake at
that date.

1. Aegiensi. Aegium (Vostitza) on
the Corinthian gulf, the chief city of the
ancient Achaia, and the regular place of
meeting of the Achaean league (Liv. 38.
30, 12), which at a later date still went
through the form of meeting there (Paus.
7. 34, 4). At this time it was probably
overshadowed by the colonies of Patrae
and Dyme (cp. Pl. N. H. 3. 4, 5, 11).

subveniretur, etc.: see on 2. 47.

2. Vibius Serenus, one of the accus-·

ers of Libo Drusus (2. 30, 1) ε see further,
c· n²22,.8ii31ct>2.erioris Hispaniae. This name
formerly included both Lusitania and

Baetica, but since the division of those

provinces by Augustus, or perhaps by
Tiberius (Momms. Mon. Anc. p. 83),
is restricted to the latter, a senatorial
province of the second rank, parted from
Lusitania (see on c. 5, 2) by the Anas
(Guadiana)‚ and coinciding generally with

- southern Estremadura, Andalusia, and

Granada. The seat of government was
at Corduba (Cordova): see Marquardt‚
Staatsv. i. p. 105.

de vi publiea. This crime consist-
ed in the execution, torture, scourging, or
incarceration in a public prison of any
Roman citizen who had appealed to Cae-
sar: cp. Dig. 48„ 6, 73 Paul. Sent. 5. 26,
1. A ‘lex Iulia’ of 746, B.C. 8, made it
punishable by ⁶ interdictio aqua et igni!

ob atrocitatem morum. The MS.
has ⁴ temporum ’ sor ‘morum,' apparently
by a repetition of the last syllable of the
preceding word. ‘Tormentorum ’ is sug·
gested by Haase. ‘Deportatio ’ to a par-
ticular island was an additional severity3

those interdicted from fire and water being.

as ‘a rule allowed to choose an island for
their residence, if not less than four hun-

dred stadia from the mainland (Dio, 56.
27, 2). At a later time deportation be·

4. Amorgus, Amorgo, one os the
Cyclades, S. E. of Naxos, contrasted as
a place of residence with Gyaros or Do·
nysa (c. 30, 2), and still a fertile island.

Carsidius sacer-doaz cp. ὁ. 48, 7,
from which the name is here restored in
the MS. for ‘ Carsius?

5. tamquam iuvisset, ‘on the ground
of having assisted ε ’ cp. 3. 7²· 5, and note

6. C. Gracchus. This person appears
to have become an informer (6. 38, 4),

Henzen (Scavi, p. 99) that a Gracchus
was also praet. peregr. in 790, A. D. 37.

1. 42, 150) applies this epithet to several
kinds of trade, and to all ‘mercatura te·

na et copiosa' and ‘non admodum vi—
tuperanda? To a Roman of senatorial
rank all trade was sordid, but the
dealings os knights, e.g. in the corn trade,
had a certain dignity.
