’ Ῑ have also gratefully to acknowledge assistance de-

ἶ Mr. T. F. Dallin, M..A, late Public Orator in the
j' University of Oxford, and formerly Fellow and Tutor
ἢ of Queen’ s College, had originally undertaken an edition
η of this portion of the Annals sor the Delegates of the
ᾗ University Press; and, after his death, the materials
'J' collected by him were entrusted to me to make such use
s of as 1 thought fit. From them has been taken the
,J chief part of the Excursus on the ‘Lex Papia Poppaea ²,'
ι as also several notes or parts of notes, especially on
’ some of the early chapters of Book 111, which are duly
[ 'acknowledged where they occur. 1 feel sure that all
’ will Join in regretting that, owing to his untimely death,
ξ. and to the pressure of other important occupations
Ξ during the years immediately preceding it, the acquire-
ι ments of so ripe a scholar were prevented from being
› made far more largely available to the student of Tacitus,
ξ Most kind and valuable assistance has also been
rendered to me by the Venerable Archdeacon Edwin
ἐξ, Palmer, D.D.‚ one of the Delegates of the University
5 Press, not only in the shape of numerous suggestions
tending to amend the substance and form of a con·
ἰ siderable portion of the Introduction and notes examined
