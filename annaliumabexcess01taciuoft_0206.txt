temporal but a causal connection is indi-
cated: cp. c. 50, 1; 54, 3; 2. 8, 33 88,
43 3. 19, 33 6. 7, 6, etc. See Dr'ager,
Synt. and Stil, ξ, 168, and a complete
collection of instances in Gerber and Greef,
Lex. S. v.

cognomento Sirpicum. ‘ cognomen-
tum’ usually denotes a real name (cp.
2. 9, 2 3 60, 3, etc.)‚ and Nipp. appears
rightly to contend that such is here
intended, though no such name as ‘Sir-
picus' is otherwise known: a nickname
would probably have been explained, as
‘cedo alteram' above, or ‘Caligu1a‚' c.

1. morti deposcit, ‘demands for
death‚' i. e. ‘with a view to his death.’
On ‘this dative of work contemplated‚
see Introd. v. 5 22 c; also note on c. 51,
4, and Madv. 5 249.

3. abstrusum, ⁴ reserved.’ This word
appears to be only here used of persons.
Similar uses of ‘tectus,’ ‘occultus‚' etc.
arehfrequent in Tacitus, but less peculiar
to im.

5. primoribus civitatis. This term
is used in 3. 65, 2, in contradistinetion
to the mass even of consulars, and prob—
ably implies family nobility as well as
personal rank. One of those sent on
this occasion is mentioned by name (e. 27,
1), Cn. Lentulus.

6. nullis satis certis mandat-is.
Nipp. notes that Tacitus often tolerates
three ⁶ homoeoteleuta,’ asin c. 5, 5 (‘pro-

' matris liten's')‚ and in one place

ex re consulturum, ‘to decide ac-

and the common expressions ‘ex senten-
tia, etc.

7. delecto, i. e. ehosen from the other
cohorts.

8. praetoriani equitia. On this force,

Germanorum. A body os Batavian
horsemen had been attached to the per-
son of Augustus (Dio, 55. ²4- 7). These
and any other Germans os the bodyguard
had been dismissed aster the defeat of
Varus (Suet. Aug. 49), but had evidently
been already restored. A similar force is
mentioned under Gaius tSnet. Cal. 43).

dismissal by Galba (Suet. Galb. 12) was

they were not slaves, yet not strictly con-
sidered soldiers, not being organized in
‘centuriae ‘ or ‘ turmae‚' but as a ‘ eolle-
gium' divided into ‘decuriae’

9. Seianus. Here first mentioned.
His early history is given in 4. 1. His
father has been mentioned (c. 7, 3).

10. collega.. Maecenas is represented
(Dio, 5²· 24, 1) as advising Augustus, as
a measure of sasety, to share the ‘ praefec-
tura praetorii’ between two3 and this
was generally the rule, though with many
exceptions, such as the solc command
later of Seianus, os Macro, os Burrus (12.
42, 2), Arrius Varus (H. 4. π, 1), etc.
All other ‘ praefecturae’ were adminis-
tered by a single praefect: see Momm·
