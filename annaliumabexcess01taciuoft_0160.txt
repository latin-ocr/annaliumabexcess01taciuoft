1. A (1). THE family history of the Octavii, with further account of the
father and mother of Augustus, is given by Suetonius (Aug. 1-4). The
distinctions of his father are enumerated in an inscription (Orell. 592),
which states that he was twice trib. mil„ also quaestor, plebeian aedile,
iudex quaestionum, praetor, and proconsul of Macedonia, where he
became entitled to the name of imperator. The date of his praetorship
was 693, 13.c. 61; and he was prevented from becoming a candidate
for the consulship in 696, B.c. 58, by his death at the very beginning
of that, or at the end of the previous year.

2. A (3). The frequency of betrothal, and even nominal marriage, during
mere *childhood‚ among Romans at this time (see Friedlaender, Sitteng.
i. p. 504, foll.), makes it possible to reconcile some such a date as that
given⁸ for Octavia’s birth with her betrothal or marriage to C. Marcellus
in 700, 13.c. 54 3 in which year it was also contemplated to give her in
marriage to Cn. Pompeius (Suet. Jul. 27). Marcellus, who was a leading
opponent of Julius Caesar, but subsequently reconciled to him, had just
died when Octavia, with contempt sor all usual decorum (see Dio, 48.
31, 3), was hastily married to Μ. Antonius in 713, 13.c. 41, by one of
the articles of the compact at Brundusium. On the honours paid to her
at her death, see Dio, 54. 35, 4.

3. Α (4). Octavius assumed the name of C. Julius Caesar Octavianus in
consequence of his adoption by the dictator's will: hence Cicero styles
him ‘ C. Caesar' in official language (Phil. 5, c. 16—19)‚ and sometimes
in private letters ‘Octavianus' (ad Att. 16. 18, 13 11, 6, etc.). On the
subsequent history of his names and titles, see vi. p. 63, etc. He had
been first betrothed to a daughter of P. Servilius Isauricus; afterwards,
on his first reconciliation with Antonius, to a step-daughter of the latter,
Clodia or Claudia, daughter of Fulvia by P. Clodius. His marriage
with Scribonia was contracted in 714, 13.c. 40, to conciliate Sex. Pom-
, peius, whose father-in-law, L. Scribonius Libo, was her brother. She
was much older than Octavianus, had been twice previously married,
and had children by P. Cornelius Scipio 3 one of whom, Cornelia, wife
of Aemilius Paullus, has been immortalised by Propertius (El. 4, 11).
He divorced Scribonia the next year, 715, B.c. 39, when her daughter
