Hortensii, inlectus a divo Augusto liberalitate deciens sestertii

1. destinarentur. This verb appears
used less strictly than ‘ designo‚’ so as to
denote elections arranged but not yet
formany promulgated: cp. 1. 3, 2 ; Agr.
9, 1, etc.; and the inscription cited on
1. 81, 2; also note on 3. ²9» 5.

3. areana imperii. Not, as in H. 1.
4, 2 ‘secrets relating to the constitution‚'
but ‘ secret principles of autocracy ε ’ cp.
c. 59, 4; 1. 6, 6. Such a scheme really
bound the choice of the princeps five
years in advanoe, precluding a change of
purpose, and making those chosen more
independent and those not chosen more
disaffected.

4. quasi augeretur. His power would
nominally by five years outlast his life,
but such posthumous choice was in fact
always liable to be set aside.

moderationi: cp. ‘modestia’ 1. 11. 1,
etc. Eckhel (vi. p. 187) notes that the
inscription ‘Moderationi‚' with an effigy,
appears on one of his coins.

5. tot eligere. etc.‘ This refers to the
first election of sixty praetoxs, etc.

8. domus, family connexione.

9. annua, ‘a year in advance.’ Prob-
ably as a fact the usual period of designa-
tion was less (see 1. 14 ; 15) ; but the sub-
ject is one of some difficulty: see Nipp.'s
note here.

ιο. agitent, sc. ‘animo,’ ‘assumed the
airs of magistrates ; ' answering to ⁶ super-
bire’ above. The ‘ magistratus designati ’

had a quasi-official position, especially in
the senate; and thus magistrates them-
selves might by a figure of speech be said
to be multiplied fivesold.
quinquiplicari, ἅπ. etp.. coined on the
analogy of ‘ multiplicari‚‘ etc.
1 2. favorabili oratione, ⁴ a popular

speech: ' so again 12. 6, 1 : cp. H. 2. 97, - Ξ

43 Dial. 7, 1. The word is first found m
Ve11.‚ also in Quint. and Pl. min.

15. Censusque . . . iuvit. Other such
gists are mentioned in ι. 75, 5, and this
practice is spoken of as frequent with him
by Vell. (2. 129, 3) and Dio (57. 10, 3).

16. Hortali. The orator is called Hor- ’,ᾗ

talus in Cic. Att. 4. 15, 4.

in paupertate manifesta.. The ha·
bits of the family seem to explain this.
The extravagances of the great orator
(see Dean Liddell, in Dict. of Biog. p.

527)‚ and the low tastes and profligacy *ἴ

of his son (Cic. Att. 6. 3, 9; 10. 4, 6),
are on record; and the remnant of the
latter's property must have been lost by
his proscription (Plut. Brut. 28, 996).
This Hortalus would appear to have got
through the gift of Augustus 3 and Hor-
tensius Corbio, probably his brother. has
the most infamous of characters in Val.
Max. . , .

17. {egessisset This mood and tense are
used as giving the view os those whose
wonder is mentioned.

18. inlectus, ‘ induced.' The word is
