TA CITUS' USE oF· HIS MA TERJALS. 23

{dted1 ς and by the paucity and insignificance os such errors of fact as
,ἕ have been clearly brought home to him ⁹. What is probably the weakest
>point in his narrative, the want of precision in its geography ³, is a defect
which he sbares with Livy, Sallust, and other authors who have had ιο
3 describe military movements on an extensive scale without the aid of
κ’ maps ⁴.

’ Two points may here be noted, in which this obligation to veracity
, is consciously relaxed.

Firstly, in the account of battles, at least os disastrous battles, he con-
Ῐ siders it a point of patriotism to conceal the number of Roman slain.

ε, This reticence, observable throughout his narrative, especially in the
[ss account os the campaigns os Germanicus, appears to have been delibe-
ὁ rately adopted as a principle, and grounded on precedent, in a lost part

,s of the Histories. ⁹ J
ᾗ The second exception relates to the practice, so common among
-ῑ ancient historians, and never regarded by them as a breach of

’ truth, os composing imaginary speeches purporting to be historical.

⁷ There is, however, reason to believe that Tacitus recognised some limit
. in this respect, as may be seen by comparing the speech assigned to
Claudius on the concession of full citizenship to the Gauls ⁰ with the
ξ extant fragments os the actual speech ⁷. These fragments appear to form
ζ’ part osa lengthy and tedious harangue; that in Tacitus is a single chapter,

’ not without trace of the pedantry οἵ the original, though elevated by his

ἶ dignified and nervous style. Still the following sentences, ir taken out
s os their order, condense the substance of the first column and the begin·
: ning os the second, and perhaps supply a link between them—

3. ⁸ Omnia P. C. quae nunc vetustissima creduntur, nova fuere. Advenae in
¹- nos regnaverunt. plebeii magistratus post patricios, Latini post plebeios,

⁴] ceterarum Italiae gentium post Latinos:

x The following sentence expresses no less faithfully some os the latter
,, part of the second column—-

” ‘Ac tamen, si cuncta bella recenseas, nullum breviore spatio quam
J adversus Gallos consectum3 continua inde ac fida pax!
