vestal Laelia (15. 22, 4) was probably his
daughter. His further fate is mentioned

she also may have been 4put to death by
Gaius.

Satrio Secundo: see 4. 34, 2. He
is mentioned more prominently than as if
he were only one of the many informers
respecting the conspiracy of Seianus (see
5. 8, 1, etc.,) and may therefore have been
the person who betrayed it to Antonia
(see Appendix iii. Ρ. 539). The past

Nip. thinks he may be the poet spoken
of s 'ghtingly in Mart. 4. 29, 7 (· quam
levis in tota Marsus Amazonide ’); most
allusions to a poet of the name being,

the ‘acta senatus‘ (15. 74, 2) and the
register of the princeps (H. 4. 40, 6, ete).
Dio (58. 24, 2) represents such a ease as
common. (ἡλίσκοντο οἱ μὲν πλείους ἐκ τῶν
τοῦ Τιβερίου γραμμάτων καὶ ἐκ τῶν τοῦ
Μάκρωνος βασάνων) ; the senate having ap·
parently to pass sentence on such a com·
munieation without further trial. In this
case it would seem probable that the ab·
sence of the usual letter from Tiberius
enabled them to suspend proceedings.
