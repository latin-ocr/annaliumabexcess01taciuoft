774, A. D. 21 ².

appears still to be so in 787, A. 1). 344.

The long tenure of appointments under Tiberius is further illustrated
by the fact that in Upper Germany C. Silius (cos. 766, Λ.1). 13) was
legatus from 767 to 774, A. D. 14-2153 and C. Lentulus Gaetulicus
(cos. 779, A. D. 26) from 782 to 792, A. 1). 29—39 ⁶; while L. Arruntius
was nominally legatus of Spain for at least ten years⁷; and Poppaeus

controlling the mixed crowd, Greek, Phoenician, and Jewish, made
subject to him, especially in his vast capital, Antioch : which, in popula—
