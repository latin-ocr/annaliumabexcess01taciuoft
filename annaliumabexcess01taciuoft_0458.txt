440 A PPENDIX Η. EXCURSUS

consulship in 726, B.c. 28 ¹, had endeavoured to deal with the subject in

the most energetic and stringent manner 5 but met with such a storm of ,

opposition as to compe] him to withdraw and modify his proposals ². In
some milder form, the ‘lex Iulia de maritandis ordinibus' was passed in
7 36, ac. 18 8; but an interval of three years was given before it should
be enforced ⁴.

Towards the close of his life, in 762, A. D. 9, he took the further step
i of procuring the enactment of a great and comprehensive measure,
designed apparently to absorb and codify much if not all of the ‘ius

civile ' on the subjects of marriages and wills. This law, fully sanctioned ⁷

⁴ by senate and comitia ⁵, is generally named after the consuls its actual

proposerS, but often called in full ‘lex Iulia et Papia Poppaea de mari-
tandis ordinibus.'

The following account of its several chapters is taken mainly from the
treatise of Heineccius ⁸ : who has collected such fragments of the text as
have been preserved, and has restored the rest from what is known
respecting its substance.

Lex Marz'lalz's.

Cap. 1. De senatorum eorumque liberorum nuptiis. ‘Qui senator est
quive filius neposve ex filio proneposve ex filio nato, cuius eorum

est, erit: ne quis eorum sponsam uxoremve sciens dolo malo habeto -

libertinam, aut eam quae ipsa cuiusve pater materve artem ludicram

facit, fecerit. Neve senatoris filia neptisve ex filio proneptisve ex
⁷ nepote filio nato nata libertino eive qui ipse cuiusve pater materve ,

artem ludicram facit, fecerit sponsa nuptave sciens dolo malo esto:
neve quis eorum dolo malo sciens sponsam uxoremve eam habeto ⁷.’

Cap. 11. De ingenuorum nuptiis. ‘Omnibus reliquis ingenuis praeter Ξ

senatores eorumque liberos libertinam uxorem habere liceto; . . ,⁸

at ne quis ingenuus eam quae palam quaestum corpore facit, fecerit;

adulterio deprehensam quaeve artem ludicram facit fecerit sponsam ,

uxoremve sciens dolo malo habeto!
