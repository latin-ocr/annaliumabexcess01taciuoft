Graeci. The general term may be
used to speak of his reception at other
cities besides Athens.

1. vetera suorum faeta dietaque.
The Greeks are called ‘laetum antiqui-
tatibus genus’ in H. 2. 4, 1 3 and Sulla,
during the siege of Athens, was incensed
by a deputation which talked to him ‘of
Theseus, Eumolpus, and the Persian war'
(Plut. Sull. 13, 460). The expression
‘facta dictaque’ is used as a formula in
c. 28, 3; 3. 65, 1; 4. 37,4; 6. 24, 1‚etc.

praeferentes, ‘ making a display
of ε’ so ‘modestiam’ ‘imitamenta,’ ‘li-
bertatem,’ ‘auctoritatem praeferre' (13.
45, 2; 14- 57, 5; 16· 22, 8; 32, 3); also
‘aviam,’ ‘avunculum praeferebat' 4. 75,
2.

2. quo plus dignationis, etc„ ‘to add
to the honour of their obsequiousness‚’ by
dignifying those from whom it came. Ta-
citus gives much the same estimate os the
Greek character as Juvenal (3, 74—108).

‘Dignatio’ is used by Tacitus elsewhere

inthissense(cp..452, 23 6.27‚2; 13.
42 8; H. 3. 80, 3); oftener in that of
political dignity or rank (c. 33, 53 3. 75,
2; 4. 16, 6, etc. The word is rare in
earlier writers.

3. tramisit Lesbum. The verb in
this sense does not usually take an accus.
without ’prep., but Livy has Uticam.
transmisit· (25. 31, 12).

4. Iuliam: see Introd. ix. note 16.
Eckhel (vi. 214) mentions Mytilenaean
coins inscribed emn— AIOAIN ΑΓΡῙΠ-
OENAN. There is also an inscription (see
Orelli’ s note) to young Nero, as son θεοῦ
νέου Γερμανίκου malea ρος καὶ θεᾶς Αἰολίδος

καρποφόρας Ἀγριππείνας.

Perinthum; on a promontory pro- η,
jecting into the Propontis; an old and ἔ

famous city, which in or aster the fourth ;
century took the name of Heraclea, whence Ξ

the modern name ⁴ Eregli ’ or ‘ Erekli!

this city to Rome to this date, see 12. 62, J

word occurs; this being the prevalent

form in· a ’and‘ e‘ ; of which the latter

(1864), who otherwise follows they MS. in · ’

its variations. On Thrace at this time, see '³

c. 64, 3, etc.

angustias, the Bosporus.

7. magistratuum. In this neighbour-
hood, Bithynia had certainly recently suf· Ἰ,
fered from its governor (1. 74, 1); but q
probably the local magistrates who had
pillaged their own treasuries (cp. 4. 45. 5)
are chiefly meant. Thus Cicero speakso of
communities in Cilicia ‘perditas.. ,Ρα- ᾗ
