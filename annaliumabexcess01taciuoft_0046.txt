senate that confronted Pyrrhus or Hannibal to that which had dragged
its own members to prison at the bidding of Domitian ¹.

Our estimate must also take account of the author's literary ten-
dencies. In one sense, not the Annals alone, but all the works of
Tacitus are satire3 for satire, in the various forms which it took under
Persius, Petronius, Martial, Juvenal, was the chief literary force of the
age²3 and a writer out of harmony with the times of which he writoe
had a whole armoury os sharp-edged maxims ready to his hand. ‘In-
mitior quia toleraverat⁸:' ‘acerrima proximorum odia⁴:’ ‘causae in·
imicitiae acriores quia iniquae⁵:' ‘proprium humani generis odisse
quem laeseris⁸'—-these and a hundred such are the forms in
which the stern and bitter experiences of the historian's life express
themselves, There are no such arrows in the quiver of Augustan
literature; they are hardly so barbed even in Juvenal. Again, we have
the satiric tendency, prevalent especially in the Annals, to take extreme
acts as typical of the man, and extreme men as typical of the age.
Not, however, that such exaggerations are on one side only: the great
literary artist knows too well the effect of a heightened contrast to
neglect the opportunities held out to him. Even on such neutral
ground as the subject of the ·' Germany’ this is thought to have affected
the historical fidelity of Tacitus; and in the portraiture of Rome under
the CaesarS, the temptation was far more irresistible. Hence the effort
to idealise a Germanictis or an Agricola, and others who might be
mentioned3 and the tendency to surround with glory the death-scene
of the martyrs.

Between this sharply drawn contrast of hideous vices and heroic
virtues, the neutral multitude of ordinary men on the dead level of
average mediocrity of character in all ranks of life, however deeply
interesting to those who would truly trace the general tendencies of an
age, fade as completely out of sight as the shadowy rank and file of
the Homeric armies,
