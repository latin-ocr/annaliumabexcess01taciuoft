CORNELII TACITI ANNALJUM [A.U.C. 767.-

and Dio (42· 53, 3). Merivale (ch. xvi.
p. 222) prefers the authority of Lucan
(5, 358), who tells this story of the earlier
mutiny at Placentia in 705, Rc. 49. In
H. 3. 24, 3, Antonius is made to reproach
soldiers as ‘ pagani? and Alexander
Severus is recorded (Lamprid. 52) to have
often disbanded legions by merely styling
them ‘Quirites’ ἃ

1. divus Augustus, etc. Other ac-
counts of this mutiny represent Augustus
as having hastily returned to Brundusium
in the winter following Actium, and ap-
peased the military discontent by rewards
(Suet. Aug. 17; Dio, 51. 3, 4). In this
passage there may be some confusion
with the incidents of an earlier mutiny,
in 719, B.c. 35, which appears to have
been more sormidable, and more ener-
getically dealt with: see Liv. Epit. 1313
Dio, 49· 34· ,

2. nos. The context shows that th1s
refers to himself alone; Tiberius not
being of the blood of Augustus, nor un-
known (see 2. 3, 4) to the Syrian legions.

ut . . . ita.. See on c. 12, 1.

3. Hispaniae suriaeve; i. e. ‘ an
army to which I was personally un-
known.’

4. orat. On the force of this indicative,
see Introd. v. ς 50 b. 2. Nipp. has here
collected instancoe of it, as also of the
subjunctive in similar expressions.

primane, etc. The construction is
partly interrogative, partly exclamatory,

⁴ as suited to the excitement of the speaker.

It has been thought from the following
words that the first legion had been
enrolled by Tiberius (cp. ‘ipsius tirones '),
probably after the defeat of Varus. But
it had not been one of the legions then
lost <see.1ntr0d. vii. p. 21), and it is un-
likely that no first legion had previously

existed. Mommsen (on Mon. Anc. p. 46)
suggests that it may have lost colours.
when the fifth legion lost its eagle, in the
defeat of Lollius (see on c. 10. 3); and
may have received new ones from Tibe·
rius after the death of Drusus. This
would certainly not entitle them to be
called his ‘tirones;' and, if the context
obliges us to restrict this to one of the

legions and ‘veteranos‘ to the other, it ·

would be far easier to sup the
twentieth‚ which probably did not exist
till 760, A. D. 7 (see Introd. l. 1.), to have
been enrolled by him for the Illyrian war.
Itis perhaps possible to suppose such a
distinction in respect of comparative
neamess in the thought of the speaker
as might justisy a reference of ‘illa' to
the legion last mentioned, but on whose
achievements less stress is laid (c . c. 70,
6, and note there); or that in e com·
position of this speech, which can hardly
be altogether treated as historical, the
antecedents of these two legions may
have been confused.

6. egregiam. In his frequent ironical
use of this word (c. 59, 3; 3. 17, 53
H. 1. 33, 3; 4. 32. 4), Tacitus appears
to follow Vergil (Aen. ἦ, 53).

duci; sc. ‘ Tiberio. The allusion
to their former service under him is still
sustained.

9. includi legatos. The mention of
these with the centurions and tribunes,
as well as the inapplicability of ‘ includi’
to the delegates of the senate, who had
already departed (c. 39, 8), suggests that
the ‘legati legionum’ are meant. No
act of violence to these has been men·
tioned, but all the superior officers must
have been under some constraint, which
would justify their being spoken of as
‘imprisoned‚‘ without greater rhetorical
