234 CORNELII ΤΑ CI TI ANNALIUM [A.U.C. 768.

annum trium legionum ossa, nullo noscente alienas reliquias an
suorum humo tegeret, omnes ut coniunctos, ut consanguineos,
aucta in hostem ira, maesti simul et infensi condebant. primum 2
extruendo tumulo caespitem Caesar posuit, gratissimo munere in
defunctos et praesentibus doloris socius. quod Tiberio hands
probatum, 'seu cuncta Germanici in deterius trahenti, sive exerci-
tum imagine caesorum insepultorumque tardatum ad proelia et
formidolosiorem hostium credebat ; neque imperatorem auguratu
et vetustissimis caerimoniis praeditum adtrectare feralia debuisse.

primum copia fuit, evehi equites campumque, quem hostis inse·

per saltus occultaverat. tunc nova acie turbatus eques, missae-3

tion of these words from c. 61, 1 has been sencias caerimonias ’ 4. 16, 6. On the

treatedvby Ern. as an interpolation, by
Nipp. as a kind of lyrieal antistrophe, or
imitation of the repetitions of sentimental
poetry. The contrast of the living with
the dead, the victorious with the slaugh-
tered army, is evidently prominent in the
mind of the writer, and it seems hardly

possible, where the composition is so elabo- ⁹

rate, to suppose such an oversight as that
noted by Dr'agen in the repetition of ‘ad

eas res conficiendas’ in two successive*

sentences of Caesar (B. G. 1. 3, 2, 3).
sextum post eladis annum. The
use of such an expression sor ‘ sexto anno
post cladem‚’ is noted as rare (Madv. 276,
obs. 6), · but several instances from writers
of this age are collected by Nipp., e. g.
‘post decimum mortis annum’ Pl. Epp.
6.10‚ 33 ‘ante quintum mensem divortii’
Suet. C1.27; ‘intra quadragesimum pug-
nae diem' H. 2. 702.

6. trahenti, ‘interpreting.’ So used
with‘ in’ or ‘ad‚' after the example of
Sall. and Liv. os the judgment formed on
an action (as 4. 64, 1, etc. ), or the motive
assigned to it (as 3. 22, 6; H. 2. 2ο, 1,
etc.): cp. ‘varie trahebaht’ c. 76, 6.

8. formidolosiorem, ‘more timorous?
The word has this sense but rarely; and
(according to Driiger) here only as a geni-

' tive of the object, on the analogy of ¹ pa-

viduS‚’ etc.

effug-aratu . .maedim‚ ‘invested
with the augurship, and its time· honoured
rituaL² ‘caerimoniam' from denoting the
duties appertaining to a religious office,
comes, in, Tacitus, almost to stand sor the

office itself: cp. c. 54, ι, and ‘ad oepes-

priesthoods held by Germanicus, see 2.
83’9.2 adtrectare feralia. Suetonius (Cal.
3) represents him as collecting the re-

mains with his own hand, which is more ’

likely to have amounted to technieal pol·
lution than what is here stated; though
the line drawn is uncertain, and probably
varied in different priestly colleges. Gel-
lius (10‚ 15) says of the flamen Dialis;
‘ mortuum numquam attingit. Funus ta·
men exsequi non est religio? Tiberius,
then one of the pontiffs, is said by Dio
(56. 31, 3) to have received a kind of in-
demnity sor touching the body of Augus-
tus and escorting it; and afterwards,
when ‘pontifex maximus,’ to have inter-
posed a veil when pronouncing the ‘lau-
datio’ os his son, lest the sight osa corpse
should pollute him (Seu. conS. ad Mar-
ciam 15, 3) : yet Dio rejects this explana·
tion (though offering no other), of a
similar action of Augustus at the funeral
of Agrippa (54. 28, 4). Again, holders
of priestly offices constantly commanded
armies, and seem to have incurred no
pollution from the carnage os battle.

1 1. eopia, ‘ opportunity ; ’ usually with
genit., as c. 58, 6 ; 2. 7, 2, etc.

evehi, ‘to charge:’ cp. ‘longius
evectum'12. 14, 4; ‘.evectus ‚equo'
Liv 4 33 7-

12. eripi, to be carried by a rusb.⁹
The word is used' m the circus osa driven·
who takes his opponent's ground (cp.
‘aequore erepto’2 Sil. 16, 390); but is
here probably a military term.
