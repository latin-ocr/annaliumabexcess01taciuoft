72 INTRODUCTION.

‘album senatorium,' and either then, or as occasion offered, expunged
the names of unworthy members ¹. We also hear, during and after this
principate, of similar regular revision of the ‘decuriae equitum' for
J'udicial purposes ², and of the ‘turmae equitum equo publico⁸ ; ' besides
special gifts or withdrawals of equestrian privileges ⁴, and the creation
from time to time of new patrician houses ⁵. These functions‚ as well as
various minor censorial duties, such as the regulation of public buildings,
of the course of the Tiber, etc„ or aedilician, as the ‘cura annonae,'
were undertaken or delegated by the princeps ⁰, whether as possessed of
any general consular power ⁷, or as in some way conceived as the chief
magistrate of the state. ’

In describing the growth of the power of Augustus from its modest
beginnings‚ Tacitus says that he gradually engrossed more and more of
the senatorial, magisterial‚ and legislative (or comitial) functions ⁸. His
encroachments on the senate and magistrates of the Republic will be
readily understood from the sketch already given of his powers3 other
magisterial encroachments may be seen in the multiplicatiori of his own
Officers, to whom he delegated duties either purely military, as to the
‘praefectus praetorio ς’ or of a mixed character, as to the ‘praefectus
urbi’ or ‘praefectus vigilum 3' or purely civil, as to the ‘praefectus
annonae,’ by whom Caesar was assisted in superseding a function of the
aediles ⁹, and in discharging what Tiberius stated to be his most arduous
and unremitting duty ¹⁰.

In respect to the laws, Caesar assumed extensive powers both legisla-
tive and judicial.

It is obvious that in right of his tribunitian power he could initiate

χ] legislation; and the ‘leges Iuliae’ of 736, 13.c. 18, were proposed
by Augustus in person in the forum¹¹z but such instances appear to
be very rare. On the other hand, there are abundant instances of
direct legislative action, even by the earliest principes, through ordi·
nances¹², forming part of their ‘acta‚' and having the soree of
