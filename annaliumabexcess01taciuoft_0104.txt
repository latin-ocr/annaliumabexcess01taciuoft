86 INTRODUCTION.

almost as high as under the republic, but also many other time-honoured
names frequent in high positions, such as those of Aurelius Cotta¹,
Cassius Longinus ², Cornelius Lentulus ³, Cornelius Sulla Felix ⁴, Do-
mitius Ahenobarbus ⁵, Furius Camillus ⁶, Junius Silanus ⁷, Mamercus
Scaurus ⁸, Scribonius Libo ⁹, Sulpicius Galba ¹⁰, Valerius Messala¹¹, and
others. Such families showed their pride of ancestry in the host of
ancestors surrounding their atrium ¹² and paraded at their funera1s¹³; and
even their unworthy members seem to have retained no small share
of popular reverence¹⁴¹. Side by side with these are the houses that had
come to the front in the revolution, as the descendants of Agrippa ¹⁵,
Pollio ¹⁶, and Taurus ¹⁷, or those since ennobled like the Vitellii ¹⁸; while a
Sulpicius Quirinus ¹⁹ under Augustus, or a Curtius Rufus ²⁰ under Tibe—
rius, are examples of men of the people rising to rank by personal
energy. Such decay of old families as belongs to this stage, seems thus
to be traceable to little else but their own hideous gluttony and luxuryss,
and ruinous ostentation ²²3 to their vast parks and villas which helped to
make the food of Italy dependent on wind and wave23, and which had
seeffled, even in the time of Horace, to be crowding the fish out of the
sea and leaving on land few acres for the plough ²⁴.

It must be borne in mind that senatorial families must have ranged in
wealth from the bare census of a million H.S.2⁵‚ exceeded by many
knights and even freedmen, to the 400 millions of an augur Lentulus ²⁶.
The greatest, with their vast estates and slave—gangs in Italy and the
provinces, and often with great sums employed in trade and usury,
through indulgent administration of prohibitory laws ²⁷, lived on aprincely
scale, and rewarded their host of retainers with almost royal munifi-
cence ²⁸. On the other hand, the amount of state and style ’of
