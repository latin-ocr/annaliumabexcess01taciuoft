1. angusta et lubrica, ‘ constrained
by narrow limits and perilous.’ The
words are joined together <but not in a
metaphorical sense) in H. 3. 82, 4: the
metaphor ‘angustae sententiae' is used in
Dial. 32, 33 and ‘lubricus‘ is often used
with this meaning, as 6. 49, 3; 51, 33
H. 1. 10, 2.

' 3. scriptores senatoresque eorun-
dem temporum, ‘contemporary writers
who were senatorsz' cp. ‘liberto et ac-
cusatori ' (16. 12, 2), where only one per-
son is meant. The fact that they were
senators is mentioned to show their means
of information ; but it is remarkable that
Tacitus does not cite the ‘ acta senatus '
themselves: see Introd. iii. p. 14.

4. Adgandestrii. The impossibility
of finding any German name of which
this might be reasonably supposed to be
a rendering has suggested the probability
of a corruption. Jac. Grimm, thinking
the name might be ‘Gandestrius’ (⁸ Gan-
ter’==‘M'annchen der Gans‘), proposes to
read the sentence ‘ ad Gandestrii . . . re-
sponsum esse ; ' but Nip . rightly objects
to the construction resu ting, as very un-

’ like the style of Tacitus.

6. non fraude: cp. the sentiment of
Livy (1. 53, 4) ‘minime arte Romana,
fraude et dolo? Tacitus elsewhere (11.
19, 4) approves of such an act, in a case
not very dissimilar, and perhaps here
thinks ,Tiberius Quixotic.

8. priscis imperatoribus. The gene-

ral authorities (e. g Liv. Epit. 13. etc.) teu
this story only of C. Fabricius Luscinus in
his second consulship, Α. U. c. 476, Β. C.
278; but Claudius Quadrigarius (ap. Gell.
3. 8) makes the letter run in the names of
both consuls, the other being Q. Aemilius
Papus. Probably, in using the plural,
Tacitus only means to speak in general
terms.

venenum, i, e. the preparation of

poison. On such pregnant uses of words, ς

cp. Introd. v. § 84.
10. abscedentibus:
tically (cp. Introd. v. ξ 54 a). Nipp.

regnum adfectans. He was of the Δ
royal race (cp. 1 1. 16, ι), but had hitherto ⁷

formed a contrast to Maroboduus (c. 44,
3). Itis suggested that his motive may not

have been personal ambition, but a desire Δ-
to unite Germany more firmly against ,

Κοιῐὲῗὶίὴθταὺοτ. Here, as below (‘bello
nou victus’)‚ Tacitus admits the unqu&-
tionable fact, qualified‚ apparently, by

the Roman belief (c. 26, 23 73, ⁴3) that J

another campaign would have compelled
submission.
14. reges ducesque, such as Pyrrhus

and Hannibal. In many elements of ⁷

military strength, Rome had been really
then more powerful than at this time.

15. ambiguus. Elsewhere (e. g. c.67, 3

1, etc.) the word, as applied to persons,
has a different meaning. In this sense, we
