:f Notwithstanding these powers, the early ‘ princeps ' has no such
}1·monarchy as that of Diocletian or Constantine; nor, on the other hand,
s does the principate follow the democratic lines traced by the dictator
Caesar, whose memory Augustan literature seems to have been instructed
rather to obliterate than to glorify ’.
The popular assemblies, suspended by the triumviri, restored, but
gradually controlled by Augustus ¹, are practically abolished at his death³.
,, From this time, whatever share they may have retained in the forms of
legislation ⁸, their most important function‚ that of electing the magistrates
of the state, survives at most in the plebiscite, following a ‘ senatus-con-
mltum: by which tribunitian power is conferred on the princeps or his
nunciate ’ς and, in other electioris, in a mere formal ‘ renuntiatio ’ of the
choico made by the senate ⁸. The importance οἱ this change is only
⁷ paralleled by the ease with which it appears to have been effected.
While the people thus cease to be an clement os the constitution, the

Caesar· have made their peace with the aristocracy, and in outward form J

share a dual government with it. There are two sets os magistrates; on
the one hand, the old republican and senatorial hierarchy os consuls,
praetura, etc. 3 on the other, the praesects and other delegates of the
princeps: the former, as of old. elected to office, grouped in ‘ collegia,’
partitioning duties by lot, with annual tenure: the latter appointed by
esem, having no colleagues ⁷, with duties specifically assigned by him,
and holding office during his pleasure.

The old magistrates are indeed styled ‘mere names⁸;' still it is ad-
mitted that, in the best days of Tiberius, ⁶ consuls and praetore had their
proper etate, even the lesser magistrates had their powers in exercise· ;'
