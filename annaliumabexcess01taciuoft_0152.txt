134 INTRODUCTION.

publica rabies‘ which under this prince caused more loss of civic lives
than any civil war ¹. The chief definite statement of Josephus‚ that the
long tenure of office by provincial governors was the result of a deliberate
intention to make them less eager pillagers ², reads like the mere excuse
of Tiberius or his friends for the irresolution and dilatoriness of which
we have such abundant other evidence ς and might have seemed question·
able to Josephus himself if he had thought of the ten years of Pilate.

If we cannot check Tacitus by these, we may in turn check by him the
keener appetite for scandal of Suetonius, many of whose tales he must
have known but disdained to notice ³, and some of whose generalisations
he has given us the means of reducing to single instances ⁴.

Also his more careful discrimination checks the loose credulity of Dio,
whose bewildered judgment seems at last to take refuge in a desperate
attempt to reconcile conflicting testimony by fusion ; in the statement that
Tiberius ‘ had many virtues and many vices, and exercised each as if they
had been his only qualities ⁵!

The appeal from Tacitus appears thus to lie to Tacitus alone; to his
eandour and sense of truth, to his admissions of fact; against his insinua-
tionsand interpretations of motives, against his evident prejudices. That
he was no friend to the founders of the principate has been already
shown ⁶ ; and, with all allowance for the sincerity of his disclaimer ⁷,
special grounds of animosity against Tiberius appear discemible. He
had seen in his own day ‘the extremity of slavery, when even the inter-
change of speech and hearing was destroyed by espionage ⁸.' He tracks
back this systematic delation to its source, and, as it were, charges this
prince with its full-developed iniquity ; seeing in these trials for treason
far more than the bare facts which he relates‚ and imagining Carus and
Massa, and the rest of the vile brood of his own time, already appearing
within view ⁹. It would be natural that the memory of the tyrant under
whom the historian had lived should enter into the portrait of that pre-
decessor in whose private memoirs he was said to find his chief mine of
political wisdom ¹⁰, and whom, notwithstanding many differences, he most
nearly resembled.

His own age, again, suggested not only a resemblance but a contrast;
between the first eneouragement of delation and its first firm repression· ,
