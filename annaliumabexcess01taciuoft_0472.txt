1. ille annus. Dio, who gives at con-
siderable length a somewhat similar sketch
of the best period of this principate (57.
7-13N‚ dates a change from the death of
Germanicus, and a further deterioration
from the retirement to Capreae.

iam primum, ‘to begin:’ so 14. 31.

2. publiea negotia. On the posi-
tion of the senate at this time, see Dio,

to the judicial processes‚ as still conduct-
ed before the senate, rather than ‘apud

3. primoribus, perhaps used more
widely than m 3. 65‚2

2, etc.

mandabatque honores. On the
rights of ⁶ commendatio ‘ and ‘ nominatio '
exercised by him, see Introd. vi. pp. 79,
80.

5. inlustres domi artes ε see 3. 70. 4,
and cp. ‘studiis civilibus’ 3. 75, 1. Here
oratorical or literary, as well as juristic

· accomplishments, would be included in
the expression.

6. potiores fuisse. This may be e-
quivalent to ‘plus potuisse? ‘that no
other persons had more influence with
him’ (cp. 1. 69 6), i. e. that the best
qualifiedp ‘prevailed3 but it is better to
take ‘potior’ 35 equivalent to ‘melion’
= ‘'preferable (cp. ‘potiora instituta’ 16.

, 22, 7); whereby the meaning would be
that those chosen were plainly the most
choiceworthy.
