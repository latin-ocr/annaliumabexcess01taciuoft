 

CONSTITUTION OF THE EARLV PRINCIPA TE. 79

ῗ gova-nors, as of old, by lot or otherwise13 from these ἱι receives all
deputations sor redress of grievances; oue such scene, that os the
audience of the many embassies on the right of asylum, being described
as unusually impressive ⁹. Petitions‚ at other times, are addressed to it
for relies os burdens ⁸, and for erection or restoration of temples‘; and
’ judicia! questions of boundary ⁸, or property ⁶. We have even survivals
os the old correspondence with foreign princes ⁷, and embassies of
honour to such as have desei-ved well of Rome ⁸.

The princeps keeps the senate constantly informed by reports os all
the more important occurrences in the provinces’; and it surprises us to
find, that even on purely military questions, though their unasked in-

to ensure a subservient senate.

Admission to this body, as well as promotion to its higher ranks, was
ordinarily gained through magistracy; and the abolition of the comitia

mend a candidate, by introducing him tp the tribes, and canvassing sor
him. Augustus originally supported his friends' tn this manner ¹³, but ιιι
aud after 761, A o. 8, a formal written ‘commendatio’ is subsututed ¹⁸
Hencesorth in each election we have candidati Caesaris ¹⁴,’ in respect os
'bomne comitia, and afterwards the senate, have a mere cong! d·lle·re²·;
