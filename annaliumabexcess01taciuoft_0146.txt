128 INTRODUCTION.

to be left with no heir but his grandson Tiberius Gemellus, a bo'y of ten
years old ².

Her overpowering influence, even to the close of life, is shown by the
description of Tiberius and Seianus ‘breaking loose, as if freed from bit
and bridle ’ζ’ and hastily despatching to the senate the charges already
drawn up, but kept back by her influence, against Agrippina and Nero.
The former is aceused of arrogant language, the latter of profligacy‚ a
charge which the general vicious propensities of this family render only
too probable, but which we must suppose to have been seized as a handle
of attack in default of other charges. It is expressly asserted that no act
of treason was alleged against either, and we infer that no evidence of
such could have been forthcoming ⁸. The characteristic irresolution of
the rescript left the senate perplexed, and even a second more peremp-
tory mandate still reserved the sentence to' be passed ⁴. With precautions
against rescue which attest their popularity ⁶, they were hurried away to
their island prisons, and, about a year later, the second son, Drusus, was
consigned to a dungeon in the Palatium ⁶. The goal at which Seianus
was straining seemed within view; yet, in spite of all the honours which
he was allowed to enj0y or hope for, his triumph was incomplete‚ and his
position insecure, for Tiberius characteristically stopped short when his
mind seemed made up. More than two years passed ⁷ before the exile
of Nero was followed by his execution or compulsory suicide⁸3 Agrip-
pina and Drusus still lived on ; Gaius was in favour, and was pointed out
as heir ⁹. Tiberius was never wholly blinded; and from his natural
temperament‚ when other causes of apprehension were removed, could
hardly fail to suspect the minister himself. Hence the conspiracy to
destroy Tiberius and Gaius is represented as a desperate stroke in self-
defence. The plotter had however met his match ¹⁰, and fell with a crash
to which Dio could find no parallel till the fate of Plautianus in his own
time ¹¹.

Seianus has not generally found favour even with the defenders of
Tiberius, but has rather been made the scapegoat of his prince. Yet
it is admitted that his influence was, at least at the outset‚ good ¹²3 and
that his fall was atnleast as great a calamity as his ascendancy¹³. And
