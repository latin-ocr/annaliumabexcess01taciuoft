26 INTRODUCTION.

their means of knowledge. Such is the general attitude of Livy
towards his chroniclers3 such again appears to be that of Tacitus
towards his ‘auctores' He could firmly reject a floating tale which
they had never recognised‚ and which was otherwise improbable¹; he
could supplement their defects in detail, Judge freely between their
differences; we can imagine him to have rejected, even in the sace of
testimony, a statement evidently inconsistent with itself or exaggerated:
but where a story was generally accepted, and did not bear plain marks
of overstatement or incredibility²‚ we cannot suppose it to have occurred
to him to ask whether its subject was one on which his authorities
were competent to speak. For instance, the details of a private cor-
respondence between Tiberius and Seianus are given without expressed
or implied suspicion ⁸, though it appears to us almost impossible to
imagine authentic evidence of them.

Any such misleading effect of a ‘consensus auctorum' would be
aggravated‚ if, as has been seen to be probable in respect to the prin·
cipate of Tiberius, the original authorities belonged almost wholly to
the hostile secdon‘. - The critic might feel that he had made a con-
siderable deductiori for their prejudices‚ and might naturally consider
that this was sufficient.

It is also noteworthy that he treats the testimony of his authorities
as evidence not only for an act but for a motive ⁵5 and only with diffi-
dence suggests an explanation as his own ⁶. Here it is probable that
the discrepancy of his witnesses left him much room for choice‚ and
enabled him, without going beyond the alternatives suggested by them,
to interpret the acts in accordance with his general conception of the
character.

Further explanation must be found in the personal opinions of
Tacitus, and in the circumstances of his life.

His political attitude to the early Caesars could not really be one of
indifference; for the revolution which they accomplished and con-
solidated was with him the main cause of the degeneracy of his own
age. Loyal as he is to the emperors under whom he wrote ; who had
‘combined monarchy with freedom⁷' and brought about ‘an age of
rare felicity, in which men might think what they would and say what
