cHARACTJ-’R Am> GOVERNMENT off· TIBERIUS. 121

 

² of Augusta ¹, and he could hardly be passed over in the award of pro-
vinces. Itis reasonable to suppose that the one mistrust was set against
the other, that he was to be some check on his young ‘imperator ¹,’ who,
in turn, was to check him by an ‘ imperium maius ⁹ on the spot. Such a
view is consistent with the belief that the full extent to which such rivalry
might be pushed was not foreseen. Nor need a word here be said on
any insinuation of the complicity of Tiberius in a death ascribed by the
superstitious to witchcraft, and by those who dispensed with evidence to
poisoning ¹: still less on the imagination apparently for a moment enter-
tained hy Tacitus that the really fatal charge against Piso, that of levying
eivilwar in the province, was somehow the outcome of a deep-laid plot
of Tiberius to destroy him ⁴.

We pass to the state trials‚ especially those for ‘ maiestas,' the one point
excepted in the summary ⁸ from the generally just administration of laws
ζ during this period.

Tacitus is himself our best authority as to the offences originally and

= subsequently made indictable under this term ⁸3 which appears to have

been gradually defined, with increasing width, by the ⁴ leges ’ ⁴ Appuleia ’
(654, ac. roo), ‘ Varia' (663, ις. 91), ⁴ Cornelia ⁹ (during the rule of
Sulla), and ‘Iulia ’ (enacted by Augustus) ς and which, even in the time
of Cicero, has a formidably elastic meaning, which would hardly require
pressing to make it cover offensive words ⁷. This applicationis, how·
ever, at least extremely limited ⁸ until the time of Tiberius, under whom it
is extended even to spoken words ἐ and the strict limitation to libels on
the prince himself and his parent¹⁸ is disregardcd in practicen.

Ἴ During this first period, about twelve trials ¹¹ may be noted, in which
f this is either the sole charge, or more frequently coupled with others ¹¹.

In two cases acts are alleged, which in any age would have been treason·

able ¹⁴, if proved ; in the other the charge is grounded either on a more or

‚ less suained interpretation of acts, or, in one or two cases, on words ¹⁸.
³ It should be added, that in three cases the charge of ‘maiestas ' is dis·
