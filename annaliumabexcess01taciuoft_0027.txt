¹, is confirmed by a coin of that city, with a representation of
[⁷2³ temple, and having all three names on the superscriptionffi

a 9. The title os pontifex, given to L. Piso, better known as praefectus
ffl’, is confirmed by the‘ Acta Arvaliumffi'

“ ro. ΊἸιο statement, that Theophanes of Mytilene had received divine
liononrs from his country-men ¹, is confirmed by Mytilenaean coins bear·
ἶ ing his effigy, with the word θεὸς added to his name ⁸.

i A few instances of less direct confirmation may here be added :—

ι. Α soldier named Rufus Helvius is mentioned as having received
‘10 civic mvn ⁷. An inscription bears the name of ‘ M. Helvius Rufus
(xvim, prim(us) pil(us),' suggesting the assumption of a cognomen re·
cording the distinction ⁸.

a. C. Silanus is stated to have had a sister, Torquata‚ ‘ priscae sancti-
moniae virgo ’.' Inscriptions mention ‘Ium‘a, C. Silani f» Torquato:
³ as 3 Vestal virgin, and as chief of that body ²⁰.

’ᾗ 3. Julius Indus, one os the Treveri, is mentioned as in command of
J 3 'delecta manus¹¹,' subsequently called an ‘ala¹¹.' His name appears
⁷ to suggest the origin os an ‘ala Indiana’ mentioned in several in-
: scriptions ¹⁸.

’ 4. Caninius Gallus is mentioned as one os the quindecimviri, and
as ’ scientiae caerimoniarumque vetus ¹⁴‚' a description suitable to a person
who can be shown to have existed at that time, and to have been
,⁶1nagister fratrum Arvalium¹⁸

Α Other instances might, no doubt, be added, but the above will prob·
3 sbly be considered sufficient,

,ἶ Another curious apparent confirmation will tend, ir admitted, to
’ carry back the date os these books nearly to that os their reputed
‘ author. In the account of the Frisian rebellion occurs the sentence
³ ‘sd sua tutanda digressis rebellibus ¹⁸! Ptolemy, writing in the gene-
ration next to that os Tacitus, in his list of towns in north Germany
’ἰ inserts 'mumma as the name os a place ”3 which certainly looks
33 t! he had the passage os the Annals before him, and misunder-
f‘ m it·
