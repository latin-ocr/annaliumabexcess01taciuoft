Tacitus in the later booksmust have been those alluded to by him ¹.
une-e, M. Cluvius Rufus⁴ is 'known to us as a consular before the
ι · of Gaius ¹, the companion of Nero to Greece ⁸, legatus os Spain
·er Galba ⁴, and as one of the train of Vitellius ³. His work has
j -αι thought to have begun as early as the time of Gaius, and to have
2 - ο the authority followed by Josephus in his description of that
f, ‘uce’s death; it would appear to have gone down to the death of
stellius· whom the historiari outlived by about a year. The other,
4³⁵ abins Rusticus, is described as too partial to his patron Seneca, but
{aa being in eloquence and brilliancy the Livy of his age'. As he

4 ' . We have no allusion to it later than the time of Nero,
ἐδιιι he appears to have been still living in the midst of the principate
„05 Traian’.

It has been shown¹⁰ that Tacitus had consulted the special history
of Domitius Corbulo ¹²; and be may also have used that of Suetonius
gratinus ¹¹: but with these our definite knowledge of even the names of
‘3 original authorities for this period ends. Bruttedius Niger, aedile in 775,

jis-n. aa ¹⁸, was a writer of history, but our only reference is to his notice
; of the death of Cicero ¹⁴. The references to Lentulus Gaetulicus, the

’τ poet and epigrammatist, hardly prove him to have been also a his-
3² torian¹⁸3 Cremutius Cordus appears to have lest off at an earlier date ¹‘;
. Vipstanus Messala ¹⁷, and probably Licinius Mucianus ¹⁸, to have begun
¹ at a later.

Further contemporary materials would no doubt be found in separate
Ῑ noeoe- of famous men, not only in the form of funeral orations, but
{j abo in that of more detailed biogmpffles, such as those of Thrasea and
Helvidius by Arulenus Rusticus and Herennius Senecio, and such
³· other precedents as Tacitus alludes to· for his own biography οι·
