20, 3); and notes the 'double construction
usedwith ‘ decemere’ in 1. 15. 4 <where
see note).

Carsidius Sacerdos: see 4. 13, 3.
He appears to have been praet. urb. in
780, A.D. 27 (see Nipp ).

2. eaedem poenae, i.e. the ‘ deporta-
tio‚’inv01ving neceSsarily the loss of se-
natorial rank. Nipp. notes that Tacitus
separated this case from that of Carsidius,
only to make a special remark on it. On
Laelius Balbus, see c. 47, 1.

5. consulari familia. He must have
been son of the consul of the preceding
year (see c. 40, 1), no other consul of the
name being found. The same expression
is used in a similar sense in 13. 12, 1.

6. informem, ‘unseemly.' i. e. ‘igno-
minious.’ as compared with the more dig-
nified forms of suicide. So Vergil 'calls a
noose sor hanging ‘nodum informis leti'
(Aen. 12, 603).

in praeceps, from an upper win-
dow: cp. 4. 22, 1.

7. repudiata. Nipp. takes this in its
ordinary sense as ⁴ divorced from her hus-
band? Others take it as ‘repelled' by
her son, which suitsthe context well;
but if Tacitus had meant this, he would
probably have used a less ambiguous
word.

adsentationibus atque luxu. Roth
appears rightly to take this as equivalent

to ‘adsentandm iuvando ad luxum?

’ ιο. advolveretur: cp. 1. 13, 7.
luctumque communem, etc„ the
grief which meu or women alike would

feel at the loss of children, and the greater
inability os her sex to bear up against it.
The bearing of the appeal is to show that
in the death of her son she had already
suffered enough.

1 1. in eundem dolorem, ‘ to the same
piteous effect,’ i.e. ‘in the same pathetic
strain : ‘ cp. ‘verba in eandem clementiam'
11. 3, 1. The constructionis a form of
the ‘in consecutivum: so characteristic of
Tacitus: see Introd. v. ξ 60 b.

1 2. diu ferret, sor ‘ proferret:’ so ‘ferre
crimina’ 12. 4, 1, etc. For the use of
⁴ diu,’ see note on 4. 69, 4.

13. minor filius, probably the person
mentioned by Seneca (de Ira, 3. 18, 3), as
a victim to the ferocious capn'ce of Gaius,
‘C. Caesar Sextum Papinium, cui pater
erat consularis, flagellis cecidit, torsit, non
quaestionis sed animi causa? He may
have taken his brother‘s praenomen.

lubricum iuventae. Tacitus has
other similar metaphora as ‘lubricum
adolescentiae‘ 14. 56, 2, ‘lubricam prin-
cipis aetatem ' 13. 2, 2, etc.

exiret. The poetical accus. with
this* verb, found here alone in Tacitus
(cp. ‘limen exire' Ter. Hec. 3. 3, 18,
‘valles’ Ov. Met. 10, 52), is analogous
to those noted in Introd. v. ξ 12 c.

14. Iam . . . nondum. The contrast
seems a reminiscence os Liv. 1. 2 5, 6 ¹ Ro-
manas legiones iam spes tota, nondum
tamen cura deseruerat)

1 5. idem animi rigor, ‘there was the
same stem will! Pliny speaks (N. H. 7.
19, 79) of ‘rigor quidam torvitasque na-
