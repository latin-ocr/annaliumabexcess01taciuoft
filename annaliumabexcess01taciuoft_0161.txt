Julia was just born3 and early in 716, ac. 38, took place the marriage
with Livia, which, though contracted under soendalous circumstances,
resulted at least in a lasting attachment. Scribonia is styled in in·
scriptions ‘ Scribonia Caesaris' (Orell. 612, Henzen 5362). She lived to
share voluntarily the exile of her daughter in 752, ac. 2 (Vell. 2. 100, 5).

4. Agrippa inscribes himself on the Pantheon, ·M. Agrippa L. F.‚·
omitting, as he usually did, his ignoble gentile name. He obtained
three consulships, of which two were consecutive (see 1. 3, 1), and
the honour, said to be unprecedented, of the ‘ corona classica’ (ven. 2.
81, 2). He was also the first ever admitted to share the tribunitian
power of the princeps (see 3. 56, 3). He was first married, probably
in 718, ac. 36, to Pomponia, daughter os T. Pomponius Atticus the
friend of Cicero, by whom he had Vispania Agrippina, married to Ti.
Claudius Nero (see Β, note 2). Pomponia, if stin alive, must have been
divorced when he married Marcella in 726, n.c. 28 (Dio, 53. 1, 2), who
in her turn was given up in 733, mc. 21, to enable him to marry Julia
(mor 54· 61 5)·

6. Α<5). Julia was married at the age os fourteen to Marcellus, in 729,
s-c. 25, and four years later to Agrippa, who was of the same age as
her father. On other projected marriages sor her, see note on 4. 4ο, 8,
on her subsequent marriage in 743, ac. 11, to Tiberius Nero, her exile
in 752, ιο. 2, and her death in 767, mn. 14, see 1. 53; Suet. Aug. 65,
66 ; Tib. 5ο.

6. Α (6). On Gaius Caesar and Lucius Caesar. see 1. 3, etc. Their
honours and title· are gathered from Mon. Anc. (ii. 46, etc.), and from
several inscriptions (Orell. 633-644). Gaius was pontifex, augur, consul
(754, mn. 1), princeps iuventutis, and imperator, apparently sor the capture
ol' Artagira (Henzem p. 60). Lucius was augur, cos. design. and princeps
iuventutis. The betrothal oi Lepida to him is mentioned in 3. 23, 1.
Α long inscription is preserved recording the honours paid to the
memory of both princes by the magistrates and citizens of the ‘colonia
Iulia Pisana' (Pisae in Etruria), of which they were patrous (Orell. 64 2,
643). The dates os their deaths are from Insc. Orell. 644.

7. Α (8). 011 the younger Julia, her exile and her death, see 3. 24, 5 ;
4. 71, 6 ; Suet. Aug. 64, 65. Her husband was son of the censor Paullus
· and Cornelia, and thus grandson os Scribonia (see note 3). Her son,
v M. Lepidus, a man os most profligate character, was put to death by
ζ. Gaius, who had previously given him Drusilla in marriage, and medi-
tated designating him as his successor. See note on 14. 2, 4; Dio.
