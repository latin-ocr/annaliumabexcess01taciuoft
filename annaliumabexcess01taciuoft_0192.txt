1. in incertum. On this use of ‘in’
to express result* see Introd. v. ξ 60 b.

2. unus metus si intellegere vide-
7 V rentur, ‘whose only ground of sear lay in
' betraying their insight.‘ Drager notes

tions are given in his note, and in Dr'ager
ξ 1403 see Introd. v. 5. 90. On the
fleets, see Introd. vii. p. 108; and, on
the dependent kingdoms (‘regn,a'), ld.
p. 102.

‘metus si’ as not elsewhere found, but
compares the use of ‘si' with ‘mir0r‚’
‘mirum‚’ ete. Here. as in ‘formido . . .
si' (11. 28, ι), it is meant that they
feared the consequence of detection‚
rather than detection itse1s; as is shown
in the fuller expression ‘si intellegere
crederetur, vim metuens' ( 2. 42, 55. The
same kind of dissimulation is described
14. 6, 13 H. 4. 86, Ι.

4. Libellum. This was one of three
documents deposited by Augustus with
his will: see Suet. Aug. 101. Another
contained instructions for his suneral; the
third. the ⁵ Index rerum gestatum ' to be
inscribed on his tomb, was the original
of the ‘Marmor Ancyranum.' The docu-
ment here described is more compre-
hensive than the balance sheet (⁴ rationes
impetii‘ or ‘ rationarium ’)‚ which he had
periodically published : see Suet. Cal. 16.
Tiberius orders the recital, to show the
magnitude of the whole. and to suggest
partition os functions.

5. open, used generally of resources,
and thus including both the forces and
revenue6: so ‘ opoe viresque’ H. 1. 61,
1; 4. 8 , 2.

6 quot classes, etc: Nipp. notes the
change from two clauses without con-
necting· particles to a third coupled by
‘et,‘ as well as from the asyndeta in-
cluded under the first clause to the con-
nection by ‘aut’ and ‘ac’ of the sub·
ordinate members of the two other
clauses. - Many instances of such varia—

tributa aut vectigalia, ⁸ direct and
indirect taxes2’ see on 13· 50.

7. necessitates: cp. 2. 27, 2. Usui
here like ‘ publicae necessitates' in Liv.
23· 48, 10, of regular charges on the
revenue, as distinct from the voluntary
‘ larg-itiones‚' such as the · frumentationes,
‘ congiaria‚' etc.‚ mentioned in Mon. Aac.
iii. 7, etc. ‘Ac' couples closely the two
kinds of expenditure, in contrast to the
kinds of income.

8. addideratque, etc. : in Diogxiphim,
56. 33, 3, this is represented as contained
in a fourth document,which is also stated
to have recommended some division of
the functions of government.

9. metu m per invidiam. On the
variation of construction, see Intmd. v.
ξ 62. Tacitus, living in the midst of the
conquests of Trajan, treats this prudmoe
as contemptible: see Introd. viii. p. 119.

10. Inter quae. Nipp. shows by many
instances (c. 15, 3, etc.) the fondness of
Tacitus for this expression, as also iot
‘post quae’ (c. 13. ι, εἴα), ‘adversim
quae’ (3. 59, 1, etc.)‚ ‘ob quae’ (2. 3ο,
4)11. din't forte, ‘ dropped the expret-
sion,' as if unguardedly. Dio (57. 2, 4)
states that he definitely offered to take
one of three depmtments, either Rome
and Italy, or the armies, or the provinces.

ut . . . ita, ‘although . . . yet.’ In

this usage (cp. c. 42, 5; 3. 43. 4 ; 4. 33,

3: 37, 5; 71, 1, etc.) Tacitus follows Α»

Livy (3. 55, 15, etc.)
