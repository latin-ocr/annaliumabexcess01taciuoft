⁷ seoondary predicate, Roby 1353) is used in some cases where the imper-
‚⁹ sonal construction would be usual in classical prose. See Madv. 400 c,
ξ obe, Zumpt 607, note. Among such may be instanced this construction
with adnotor 13. 35, 6; dubitor 3. 8, 4; speror H. 2. 74, 3 ; and with
tenses compounded of the past participle, as creditus est 6. 50, 63 14.

Tadms appears to prefer the persona! construction where a single
- personal subJect is spoken of, and the impersonal in other cases», but even
:- this rule is by no means without exceptions. The personal construction
isused generally with verbs osaccusing (see ᾖ 44), as with accusor 4. 22, 4 ς
, arguor 2. 5ο, 3; convincor 4. 31, 5 5 deseror 2. ²7, ις incusor 6. 3, 3.
