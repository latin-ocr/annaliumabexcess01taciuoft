ROME UNDER 4UGUSTUS ΛΝΒ TIBERIUS. 9 5

os these provinces were appointed usually by lot, with annual tenure;
Asia and Africa being reserved for consulars, the others, as a rule, given
to ⁴ praetorii ς ’ but that both classes of governors are properly styled pro-
consuls ¹, and have, as in old times, each his attendant quaestor ς and
also, in praetorian provinces one, in consular three ‘legati ¹ ; ’ who are
sully styled ‘legati propraetore ⁸,’ though sometimes even consulars ⁴.
The proconsul received a salary from the treasury⁸ and had also the
lictors and other insignia of his rank, except the military dress and sword,
withdmvm to denote that he had no longer power to execute a soldier ⁸.
Some further checlt was placed on him by the presence of a Caesarian
officer, the ‘ procurator fisciss whose functions, originally strictly limited ¹,
received such extension as to encroach considerably on those of both
quaestor and proconsul ⁸.

proconsulates may bc drawn from such lists as can be compiled of the
proconsuls os Asia and Asrioe during this period. In Asia the following
