de equitibus Romanis consultavisse‚ ita, si maritus Liviae quae-

usurum.

tem gloriam efferet,’ but the passage
seems not seriously meant.

statim, i. e. ‘ simul cum principatu.’

1. insatiabiliter; in Lucr. 3, 907 ;
Pl. Epp. 9. 6, 3.

2. contemptu, ‘ through despising.'
Such an ablative appears to be inter-
mediate between instrumental *and causal:

5. moris . . . tum erat. The eustom
had been introduced by Julius (Plut.
Caes. 17, 716), and was adopted by Au-
gustus for all important communications,
even towards Livia (Suet. Aug. 84). Taci-
tus appears to imply that it no longer
obtained in his time.

6. eius, sc. ¹ scripti‚’ substituted in

is difficult to see *what authentic record
could have been known to Tacitus of this
letter or the reply. ἥ . Δ .

opinion is illustrated by Nipp. from⁴ Agr.
43, 4, also from Cic. ad Fam. 10. 1, 4
(⁶ quidquid in eum iudicii officiique con-
tuleris ), and 13, 46 (‘ patroni iudicio or-
natus ’) ; Plin. Epp. ad Trai. 4, 6 (‘ ut . . .
gloriari iudiciis tuis possim ’).

could be justified, even if the intention

could no longer be carried out. -
13. in conlocanda filia. Suetonius

(Aug. 63) states that, after the death of ΒΞ

Agrippa, several persons, including some
knights, were thought of in choosing a

husband for Julia. In c. 40, 8 C. Procu- 3

leius is instanced.
14. ita, ‘ after this example.¹

rum, ‘who would gain only honour by

such an alliance:' cp.

‘ tantum infamia ζ

litical advancement, for he had no wish Ψ
to give up his ‘ praefectura’ (held only {³135v
by knights) and to become a senator. He 3,
must have retained his command with 313-
senatorial rank when he became consul 5²⁶¹,
in 784, A.D. 31, and the office was after· ’Δ
wards sometimes held by senators (cp. ;

H. 4. 68, 3 ; Suet. Tit. 6).

16. satis aestimare. Nipp. renders
this ‘he sufficiently appreciated (knew
how to value rightly, and would therefore '³2'ss
desire no more than) the protection af-

forded to his house,’ etc„ contending
⁶ aestimare ’ has never the force of ‘ existi-

that

mare.' But the frequent use of simple
verbs for compounds in Tacitus (Introd. ³}
v. 5 40) must be borne in mind, and the ³ =
meaning of ‘ existimare‚’ apparently most . 2 ,ἐ

suitable here, is not impossible in 13. 42, λέ·

5 (‘ gravius aestimandum ’).
