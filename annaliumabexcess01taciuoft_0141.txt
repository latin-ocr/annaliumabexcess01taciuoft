of rank and wealth ¹, still more for the needy and obscure ⁸, suchaeareer
had thus manifold attractions. But Roman moral sentiment drew a strong
distinction between those who had a right to accuse or were deputed to
do so, and those who volunteered for the duty⁸3 eonfining to the latter

class the odious name of ‘ delator ⁴.’

By considering the strength of the impelling motives, we are led to see
a plain truth in the maxim of Domitian at his best time, that ‘ the prince
who does not check aecusers stimulates them ⁸ ε’ and there can be no
doubt that Tiberius encouraged them from the first, both in this sense
and even in a more substantial manner⁸; and that (notwithstanding a
few precedents under Augustus⁷) his principate is so marked by the de·
velopment of delation as to be not unjustly termed the period οῖ its

origin⁸.

We must suppose him to have intended the natural consequence, to let
men see that the accuser was always on the watch, that even trivial acts
or mere words, even the pasquinades so natural to Italian scurrility, were
well within the scope ol* the law and placed them at his mercy3 that by legal
fictione their own household might be forced to give evidence against
them’, that the senate was only too forward to condemn, while the
princeps reserved to himself the credit os extending clemency to the

convicted.

We need not attribute this to any other motive than to his general
policy oskeeping himsels' m the background and using the instrumentality
os others, and to thst constitutional sels-distrust and suspicion, which
made him even at the outset feel insecure, unless surrounded by an amos-
pbere os intimidation. On any interpretation, while giving sar more credit
than Tacitus gives at this time sor a genuine desire to govern well, we
are compelled to qualisy our praise by ⁴ si maiestatis quaestio exi·
