1. Philippopolim, ‘Philippopoli,' in
the upper valley of the Hebrus (Maritza),
still one os the most important towns of
Roumelia.

Philippo, the father of Alexander the
Great.

eitam: ep. 1. 39, 4. Tacitus nowhere
else (cp. 2. 7, 3; 4. 55, 6; 6. 41, 2, etc.)
uses this participle with the prep. and
abl. : whence some would read ‘ positam ’
(see Halm, Comm. Crit.), on the analogy
of ‘posuere ’ in 12. 63, 1.

3. P. Vellaeo. He appears to have
succeeded Flaccus in Moesia (see 2. 66,
33 also note on 1. 80, 1). He has been
thought to have been the brother of the
historian‚ and to have been praetor with
him in 767, A. D. 14 (Vell. 2. 124, 4).
Nipp. thinks· him probably brother to C.
Vellaens Tutor (eos. suff. in 781, Α. D.
28), who was one of the authors os the
‘ lex Iunia Vellaea?

exereitum praesidebat. Tacitus
uses the accus. with this verb in the An-
na1s (4· 5, 1; 72, 6³ 12. 14, π 29. 3),
after Sall. (H. 2. 28 D, 34 K, 52 G), and
analogously to his usage with many other
verbs (Introd. v. ξ 12 c).

4. alarios equites ae levis eohor-
tium, i. e. auxiliaries, as opposed to the
legion mentioned below (‘robur peditum') :
cp. 12 31, 5. ·On the genitive, cp. Introd.
v. 32 c. ’ ’

5. praedabundi, those described (c.'
38, 6) as ‘ turbantes praesentia!

&regis . . . eruptione. Mommsen
cites (Eph. Epig. ii. p. 256) an inscrip-
tion commemorating the preservation of
Rhoemetalces, and of Pythodoris (see on
2. 56⁴5 67), who had been besieged with
him. ‘Eruptione ¹ and ‘adventu ’ are

instrumental ablatives, but are coupled
to the abl. abs. preceding (cp. c. 37, 1).

9. aciem aut proelium, ‘pitched battle
or even conflict.’

diei. The inf. pass. after ‘decet' is
rare, but in Cic. Tusc. 1. 14, 3²3 Verg..
Aen. 12, 797.

ιι. Galliarum. Os the four Gallie pro-
vinces, two are wholly unaffected by this
rising, namely, the senatorial Gallia Nar-
bonensis, and the Caesarian province of
Aquitania in the south west: but the re·
bellion embraced, or was intended to em· ’
brace, considerable part of the other two; ,j
of which Gallia Lugdunensis included the ζ
country between the Loire, Scine, and ζ
Saone; and Belgica all between the Seine .
and Rhine, except what belonged to the .-
‘Germaniae’ (see on 1. 31, 2). To the
former province belong the Aedui, also
the Andecavi and Turoni (c. 41, 1) ; to
the latter the Treveri.

aeris alieni. Such indebtednoes
was not uncommon among provincial
states and individuals. Thus the Allo-
broges in Catiline’s time were ‘publice
privatimque aere alieno obpressi (Sall.
Cat. 40). Besides the general muses men-
tioned by Nipp. (cp. also Marquardt, -r
Staatsv. i. p. 400), such as·financial mis-
ΐιῖιὲῗὶἲὲῗέῖπῗεῗῖῗῖἶιῗέἓὲῗΐὲἰγὴξῖἔέαἱῗὶ
here be added a special cause arising
the requisitions of Germanicus (cp. 2. 5,
3). The claims, however usurious, of
Roman creditors against provincials, were
backed by the whole soree of government
(e. g. the claim of Brutus on the Salami-
nians of Cyprus, Cic. Att. 5. 21; 6. 2);
so that rebellion was the only refuge.
Dio (62. 2, 1) assigns the usury of Seneca
