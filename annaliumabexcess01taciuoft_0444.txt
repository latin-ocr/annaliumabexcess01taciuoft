Plautus (Rud. Prol. 25), Sall. (Cat. 9. 2,
etc.)‚ and Liv. (22. 57, 5).

‘ludi magni, ⁴ votivi circenses!

1. quindecimviri septemviris si-
mul. The sormer had charge of the
Sibylline Books (cp. 6. 12, 1, etc.) and
special charge of ‘ludi saeculares’ (11.
11, 4). The collegium, at first of two,
was raised *to ten when *opened ‘to ple-
beians, and to fifteen by Sulla: see Mar-
quardt, Staatsv. iii. p. 365. ‘Triumviri

' epulones ’ to preside at the ‘ epulum Iovis ’
were instituted in 558, Bc. 196 (Liv. 33.
42), and the number was subsequently in-
creased to seven, and by Julius Caesar to
ten (Dio, 43. 51, 9), though the name of
‘septemviri’ continued: Marquardt, p.
334. These two, with the pontiffs and
augurs, formed the four great priestly
colleges.

2. simul. On this prepositional use,
cp. Introd. v. ξ 63.

Augustalibus: cp.·1. 54, 1.

3. L. Apronius: cp. 1.56‚ r, ete. His
motion was perhaps grounded on the fact
that Augustus had been a ‘fetialis;' a
reason equally valid to include the ‘ so-
dales Titii' (see Mon. Aac. Gr. iv. 7).

4. distincto, ete„ ‘distinguishing the
legitimate functions of the priesthoods
and going-back for precedents.¹ These are
explained by ‘neque enim,' etc„ as show-
ing that the fetiales had never had ‘ hoc
maiestatis,' i.e. had never ranked in dig-
nity with the four great colleges. On the
functions of the fetiales in connexion
with the ceremonies os war and treaties,
see' Marquardt, iii. p. 398, etc.

following clause, as in 4. 4, 6.

5. ideo Augustales, etc. This anti-
cipates the objection :that neither were
they among the old great ⁶ collegia.’
They were again associated with them in
the thanksgivings on the fall of Seianus
(Dio, 58. 12, 5), probably for a similar
reason.

8. Exsequi, ‘to set forth in detail? cp.
4. 4, 6; 11. 21, 13 12. 58, 13 ·Dial. 16.
2: also in Liv.. Pl. mai„ Quint ‚ etc. cic. »
has ‘verbis exsequi (ad Fam. 11. 27, 6).
This chapter, though it does not appear ‘q'
to relate to those immediately preceding, ξ
leads from such motions as-those mention· ³.

9. notabili dedecore. These words ’-
are probably best taken, with Nipp.‚ asi
an abl. os quality; as ‘notabili,' while ··
corresponding well to ‘insignes,’ wouldv
be somewhat tautologous, if taken as
depending on it. ¹-

Tacitus, as 2. 85, 53 6. 7, 4. etc.
thus used absolutely *in the sense of ‘poi‘¹
soned ' or ⁶ tainted ’ by Plin. (H. N. 9. yffi
6. 18), who also thus uses ‘inficimus*·
(Id. 18. 1, 1, 3). ,

Ateius Capito, etc. ³
