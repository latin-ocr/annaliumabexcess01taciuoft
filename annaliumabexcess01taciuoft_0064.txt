factus . . . et exercitus 14. 56, 5. Among earlier writers, Horace most
frequently uses this Graecism. Dr. ξ. 152 b, Roby 1361, Kennedy

48. 'I'he Histoi-ie present is extremely frequent. It is so far treated
as a past tense as to be once coupled with the perfect, H. 3. 16, 4 mis-
cetur intulitque3 and to be coupled with an imperfect in a dependent
clause, as nihil reliqui faciunt quominus . . . permoverent 1. 2 1, 4 ; especially
(as in Cicero, etc.) when such a clause precedes it, as ut omitteret maritum,
emereatur 13. 44, 1. Dr. § 27 c.

49. Tacitus carries much further the usage, very rare before Livy, of
interposing, in the midst of ‘ oratio obliqua,’ a parenthetieal or
explanatory relative clause in the indicative. Parenthetical clauses
are found chiefly with dum, as 2. 81, 3; 13. 15, 7; 14. 58, 43 15. 45,
63 59, 6, etc.; also with quia 3. 6, 53 4. 25, 1, etc.; with sive 1. 10, ¹3
with postquam 4. 10, 3 ; with quotiens 14. 64, 5. Among the relative
clauses are qui fecere 1. 10, 13 quae petiverant 1. 36, 43 quae expres-
serant 1. 39, 33 and many others. Dr. ξ 151, Nipp. on 1. 10. On
other parentheses see § 80, and on other changes from ‘obliqua' to
‘ recta oratio,’ see § 94.

50. 'I'he rhetorical use of the indicative for subjunctive in the
apodosis of conditional sentences, when the leading proposition is con-
ceived as independent of the condition (see Madv. 348, Zumpt 519), is
remarkable in Tacitus for its frequency.

(a) In the perfect or Izz'slorz'cal present, with suppression or contraction
of the proper apodosis, as bellum . . . mandat, ni deditionem properavissent
2. 22, 3 (as though ‘ et bellum iis illatum esset’ had been added). Cp.
16. 28, 33 H. 1. 64, 43 Agr. 4, 1. Dr. ξ 199.

(b) In the tmperfict.

(1) Of an incomplete action or tendency,to show vividly whatwas
on the point of happening3 the protasis almost invariably (an exception
is noted in 1. 23,- 3) following the apodosis, and being almost invariably
introduced by ⁴ nis-as ferrum parabant, ni 1. 23, 6 ; deferebat . . . , ni 35, 53

s trudebantur . . . , ni 63, 3 3 and very many others. Dr. § 194, Roby 1574.

An ellipsis may be supposed here as in the case above.
(2) To express what might, would, or should have been, in
forcible contrast to what actually is, as si .. . aspernaretur, tamen
