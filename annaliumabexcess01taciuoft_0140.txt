missed before trial¹; and that three others result in acquittal’g and
that the one case in which death is inflicted for an offence of words takes
place in the absence of Tiberius, who finds fault with, and takes measures
to prevent in future so precipitate a sentence ³.
It may be admitted that the number of cases is not large in itself‚ and
,that many among this number seem due to the desire of accusers to
secure a conviction by multiplying counts in the indictment‚ especially by
adding a charge not less sweeping and formidable than the modern
phrase of ‘ conduct calculated to bring the government into con-
tempt 3 ' a charge especially difficult to meet under such a constitu-
tion as 'that of the Caesars, resting on innumerable vague lines and
fictions. We may also admit that Tiberius, though with frequent
vacillations of purpose ⁴, shows on the whole at present no disposition to
press for convictions‚ or for extreme sentences upon conviction. On the
other hand, even a small numerical list of such trials becomes consider-
able, when viewed in relation to a period of profound tranquillity and
acquiescence ; when, with insignificant exceptions, the air is stirred by no
conspiracies ⁶, and the nobles are servile, even to the disdain of their
ruler 5⁵. We are sar removed, both from such an open outbreak in the
senate as that which had forced Augustus to withdraw the ‘Lex Iulia
maritalis ζ’ and even from the attitude of the Stoic aristocrats under Nero;
and the opposition has shrunk into epigrams⁸, the babble of ‘dinner
parties and places of resort ⁹,' ‘idle murmurs 1⁰‚’ ⁴ whispers or suspicions
silence ¹¹;' in a word, into what no despotism has ever been able to
repress, and what no strong government need ever consider dangerous.
Nor are the charges in themselves so noteworthy as the accompany-
ing growth of an organized system os delati0n‚ destined to acquire such
fatal prominence for nearly a century afterwards. In Rome, at all times,
the absence of a public prosecutor threw the duty of accusation on
individuals3 and the‘desire to conduct an impeachment was always
strong among Roman orators3 all the more so under the Empire, from
the closing of other roads to distinction, and the increasing prevalence of
rhetorical schools‚ in which the brilliant strokes of a fashionable accuser
are held up to the admiration of the rising generation ¹². Even for me'n
