10 et Caesar maiore fama fuit. ceterum Urgulaniae potentia adeo 8
nimia civitati erat, ut testis in causa quadam, quae apud sena-
tum tractabatur, venire dedignaretur. missus est praetor qui
domi interrogaret, cum virgines Vestales 1n foro et iudicio audiri,
quotiens testimonium dicerent, vetus mos fuerit.

15 35. Res eo anno prolatas haud referrem, ni pretium foret Cn. 1
Piso'nis et Asinii Galli super eo negotio diversas sententias

1. nee . . . optemperavit. Walther

in and after the Augustan age, the force
shows that Piso, who claimed some sum

of‘ne...

of money, must have cited her publicly
(‘veni mecum in ius‘), and, on her dis-
regard, would have dragged her by force,
aster ‘antestatio,' from the house of
Tiberius: cp. ⁸ trahere in ius Urgulaniam
domoque principis excire ausus’ 4. 21, 1.
Tiberius offers to appear as her ‘ad-
vocatus,’ and manages to gain time,
during which the money is paid into
court by Augusta. All this takes place
in one day.

2. abscessit: so Halm., Or., Nipp.
after Jac. Gron.; for the MS. ‘ abscissit,'
which has also been corrected to ‘ab-
sistit’ and ‘abstitit.’ We have thus
⁸ abscedebat’ (6. 36, 1), and the full ex-
pression ‘abscedere incepto’ (Liv. 26.

, 2).

7 3. violari et imminui, ‘was being
affronted and lowered.' Τὴε latter verb
has accus. pers. only here and in 14.
7, 1.

⁵ haetenus . . . ratus, ‘considering
that, on the footing os any other citizen

s (cp. 1. 12, 6, etc.,) he could so far gratify

his mother, as to say, '.etc
5. prooessit Palatio. On the abl„ cp.
c. 19, 2, etc. .
militibus. see 1. 7 7.
7. tempus atque iter, hendiadys.
such m Tacitus, see Introd. v. §- 76.
9. noque . . . θῦε( et Piso non in
glorius, et,’ etc. ‘'Nec and‘ neque 'have,

On

quidem‚' whether in the sense
of ‘not either,‘ as here and in c. 51, 3:
82, 53 4. 26, 2, etc.; or in that os ‘not
even‚‘ as 4. 34, 3. For instancoe from
other authors, see Roby 2232: cp. also
note ou c. 40, 6; 3. 54, 11.

10. maiore fama, for his ‘civilitas’
On his practice in causes between him-
self and citizens, see 4. 6, 7.

12. missus, etc. This practice seems ⁷

to have been subsequently more common·
cp. ‘ad personas egregias, eosque qui

valetudine impediuntur, domum mitti ⁷

oportet ad iurandum’ Paul. Dig. 12. 2,
1, 15.

14. quotiens, with subjunet. as in ’

c. 2, 5.

15. Res prolatas. The regular expres· ‘³ss

sion for the vacafion, during which the

senate and courts were adjourned for the ’

‘villeggiatura’ (‘ubi res prolatae sunt
quum homines rus eunt’ Plaut. Capt.'1.
1, 1o): cp. Cic. Mur. 13, 283 Att. 14. 5,

2. etc. The question here was whether »ᾗ

this was to be arranged to suit the oon-

venience of Caesar, who had professed an ἑ
intention to be absent at a time when ¹¹*
important Italian and provincial business
was to have been transacted. It would ’ξ
appear to have been still his frequent
habit to be present in the law courts .

(cp. 1. 75, 1) as well as the senate.
pretium: cp. 1. 57, 4.
