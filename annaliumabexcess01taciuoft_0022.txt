more successful in apparent than in substantial results, os Marius
Priscus, proconsul of Africa1. It is on this occasion only that any
particular cause pleaded by the great orator is recorded, or the grave
dignity of his oratory especially mentioned ².

Nothing further is known of his personal history, nor is there any
evidence that he outlived Trajan. His descendants also are unknown
to uS, but he was claimed as an ancestor by the emperor Marcus
Claudius Tacitus, in the third century ³, and by Polemius, a friend of
Sidonius Apollinaris, in the fifth ⁴. It was probably at the earlier of
these dates that the people of Interamna (Terni)‚ the birthplace of
Tacitus the emperor, claimed the historian also as their citizen; and
erected a tomb to him, which remained till the latter part of the six-
teenth century, when it was destroyed by order of Pius V, as that of
an enemy of Christianity ⁵.

The date of completion and publication of his various works rests
on internal evidence.

The Dialogue ‘de Oratoribus' is, by most critics, accepted as his,
and as his earliest work. It professes to have been written some time
after the discourse was held ⁶, but can hardly be dated later than the
earlier part of Domitian's rule ⁷.

The ‘ Agricola’ belongs to 850 or 851, Aa). 97 or 98. Some expres—
sions in the beginning best suit the time when Trajan was associated
with Nerva. At the end TraJan 1s styled‘ princepsssff

The‘ Germania' is also to be assigned to the latter of these yearS,
from a computation of time to the second consulship of Trajan⁹.

. The ‘Histories' must have appeared after the apotheosis of Nerva,
but probably early in the principate of Trajan, before the ‘ Annals’
were even contemplated ¹⁰.

This last work must have been completed when the conquests of
Trajan had reached their highest point, in 868 or 869, Λα). 1 15 or 116,
and before the retrocession under Hadrian ¹¹.

There is no evidence that his intention to write the history of Nerva

and Trajan ¹², or his later project of writing that of Augustus-‚¹³2 were
ever carried out.
