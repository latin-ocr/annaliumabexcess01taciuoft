130 INTRODUCTJON.

the rest of his narrative is little more than that of a prolonged reign
of terror.

Tiberius is rhetorically described as never tired of trials and con-
demnations and never satiated ¹, even stimulated by them to further
carnage ², like a wild beast who has tasted blood. Some are con·
demned before his private court at Capreae⁸5 others by the senate
without form of trial, on a mere letter of accusation or minutes of
evidence sent to them ⁴. We are told of universal panic, in which
even the highest stooped to the informer's trade, for self-preservation‚
or even as if infected by a plague; that men perished for old offences
as much as for recent; for words as well as deeds3 even for words
spoken in private life ⁶5 that even the walls seemed to have ears.

Here again the description seems somewhat to outstrip the facts.
We still note cases of pardon‘ and acquitta1⁷ 3 some escape by giving
information⁸ ; others by adjournment⁹ ; or by being merely ignored¹⁰;
others receive less sentences than death ¹¹3 prudent men, like M’. Le-
pidus¹²‚ or L. Piso ¹³, or Aelius Lamia ¹⁴, can still hold their own in
honour.

We have, indeed, a weary list of victims, of whom about forty names
are specified ; who were either put to death or committed suicide
before the last extremity. Among them are Agrippina ¹⁵ and her second
son ¹⁶, and her old enemy Plancina ¹⁷ ,Tigranes‚ ex· -king of Armenia¹⁸3
the distinguished senators Asinius Gallus ¹⁹ and L. Arruntius⁹⁰; and
others, noble and ignoble, foreigners as well as native citizens. To
these an addition must be made for such names as may have been

noted in the lost part of Tacitus 31; also for the recorded execution at .

once of an unnamed number, detained in prison as accomplices in ⁷
the conspiracy of Seianus ²². On this occasion, the ‘immensa strages’
of Tacitus may probably be reduced to the ‘twenty in one day’ of
Suetoniusae: but when all allowance is made, probably from 80 to
100 lives in all may have perished in the six years' reign of terror; j
most of them by direct mandate of the prince, though in one or two ’
cases Macro is thought to have acted in his master's name ²⁴. ’
