21 (3. 39, 1); and Pomponius Labeo in
779, Ab 26 (4. 47, 1; 6. 29, 1): but of
these only Flaccus, who was appointed
for a special purpose, is known to have
been a consular, and Labeo was certainly
not such. It is therefore possible that
these stood in some subordination to Sa-
binus. See note on 4. 47, 1.
morum. This plural form of the
classical usage, ‘ moris est,' appears to be
new.' On similar genitives, see Introd. v.
continuare imperia. For instances,
see Introd. vii. pp. 99, 100. The same
long tenure was given to his fiscal officers:
see 4. 6, 5.
2. iurisdictionibus. In Caesar's time
the govemment of a peaceful province
was mere ⁴ iurisdictio’ (ad Q. F. 1. 1, 7).
Hence Em„ who is· followed by Mar-
quardt (Staatsv. i. p. 407), refers this term
here to the senatorial provinceS. But
only the direct appointments of Tiberius
seem here spoken of, and among the
Caesarian there were peacesul provinces,
under procurators, or even under ‘le-
gatia’ to which the term may well be ap-

p causas. etc. To those here men-
tioned, may be added that which Josephus
(Ant. 18. 6, 5) quotes as assigned by
Tiberius himself, that ‘it is better to
leave the gorged flies on a sore than to
drive them off (see Jntrod. viii. p. 134);
and the complanat, also alleged by him-
self, that the best men constantly de-
elined the office (6. 27,‘3). Dio (58. 23, 5)
alleges the reduction in the ranks of the
senate as the muse, in later γεω, both of
these and of the prolonged tenures of
senatorial provinces.

this habit, even in small matters, from the
fact that the types of his coinage show
hardly any change after this year (Eckh.

was as irresolute, as his perception was

up his mind at their appointment (in
which case there would be no ‘haesitatioffi

would let them go.

the consular as well as other electioris
