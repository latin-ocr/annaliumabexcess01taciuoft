544 CORNELII TA CI TI ANNALIUM [A. U.C. 784.

obtestor ne memoriam nostri per maerorem quam laeti reti-
neatis, adiciendo me quoque iis qui fine ‘egregio publica mala
effugerunt.’ .
V. ’1 (VI. 2). Tunc singulos, ut cuique adsistere, adloqui animus 1
5 erat, retinens aut dimittens partem diei absumpsit, multoque
adhuc coetu et cunctis intrepidum <fultum eius spectantibus, cum
superesse tempus novissimis crederent, gladio quem sinu ab·
diderat incubuit. neque Caesar ullis criminibus aut probrisa
defunctum insectatus est, cum in Blaesum multa foedaque
10 incusavisset.

V. 8 (VI. 3). Relatum‘inde de P. Vitellio et Pomponio Secundo. 1
illurn indices arguebant claustra aerarii, cui praefectus erat, et
militarem pecuniam rebus novis obtulisse; huic a Considio

‘f praetura functo obiectabatur Aelii Galli amicitia, qui punito
15 Seiano in hortos Pomponii quasi fidissimum-ad subsidium per-
fugisset. neque aliud periclitantibus auxilii quam in fratrum2

tion of ‘ praefecti‚’ show that the ⁸ aera- .
rium militare’ is meant, on which see 1.
78, 2. The ‘aerarium populi’ was in
charge of some of the praetors of the year

4.. ut cuique adsistere, etc. It is
perhaps best, with Walther‚ to make this
answer to ‘ retinens aut dimittens,' by un-
derstanding ‘ aut non erat' aster ‘ animus

erat.’ Pfitzner (p. 43) thinks that the
MS„ which in the next line reads ‘ad-
sum it’ for ‘absumpsit‚' has here the
simi ar error of ‘adsistere ’ for ‘absis-
tere ;' as ‘adstitit‘ is generally taken to
be an error for ‘ abstitit' in 2. 31, 3.

7. superesse tempus novissimis,
‘ that there was time yet to spare for the
last extremity ς’ i.e. ‘that his end would
not come just yet? ¹ Novissima ' is used
‹82f death, as the extreme penalty, in 6. 50,

, etc.

9. Blaesum, the well-known uncle
of Seianus (3. 35, 2, etc.) and ‘impera-
tor' (3. 74, 6), who appears to have
fallen amongst the first victims. The
fate of his two sons is mentioned in 6.
40, 3.

10. incusavisset. This verb has no-
where else this construetion3 but Drager
notes stom Livy the -analogies ⁸ increpare
in· (1. 51, 1), ‘exsecrari in‘ (30. 20, 7),
‘ detestari in ' (39. 10, α). ’

’ ’ 11. Rvitellio, etc. On Vitellius, see

Considio. Nipp. gives here sever-al ὲ

instances to show that even persons of ζ’

rank are frequently mentioned by one

name, when a title of dignity is added, as ¹

Borghesi (iv, 444) suggests that the adop·
tive father from whom Seianus derived -·
his gentile name was probably the knight ⁴

Aelius Gallus (see on 4. 1, 2) 3 as Velleius

(2. 127, 3) assigns to him no nobility
through this source, and the other families
of the gens Aelia were consular. ⁷

15. fidissimum ad. subsidium. The ·
metaphor is from a hai-bour: cp. 3. 1, ²3 f

41667.» {rati-um. On Quintus, brother-of >-

this Pomponius, see 6. 18, 2. Vitellius

had three brothers. of whom the best ψ.
known is Lucius (6. 28, 1,etc.); another, ²
Quintus, had been expelled from the senate 1

(2. 48. 3); a third, Aulus, who is prob· υ
ably the one here meant, was cos. suff. in
the year following this (Ι. R. N. 19⁶⁸* “
Orelli 4033), and died in office (Suet.
Vit. 2).
