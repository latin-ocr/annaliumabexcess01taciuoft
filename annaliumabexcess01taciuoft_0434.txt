tribuniciam Druso petebat. id summi fas-tigii vocabulum Au-a

expression: cp. ‘quasi . . . quandam' Cic.
de Am. 13, 48.

2. nostra aetas, i. e. that of Trajan.

multa laudis et artium, ‘ many
examples of noble character and talent : ’
‘ artes ' are here used sor the ‘ bonae artes '
of 2. 73, 4, ete. In H. 1. 3, 3, he similarly
describes the age as not wholly ‘virtu-
tum' sterile.'

3. haee nobis in maiores certamina.
Most editors have inserted ‘ in,’ with
Lipsius, to complete the expression. The
construction ‘ certamen in aliquem’ is no—
where found, the nearest parallel in Taci-
tus being ‘ambitio' in posteros‘ (6. 46, 4),

and other uses of ‘ in' with the sense of

¹‘in relation to’ (cp. 4. 11, 23 12. 6, 53
Introd. v. ξ 60 b); a meaning perhaps
suitable to such a figure as that of a con-
test between those who are of different
generations. The reading preferred by
Nipp. ‘haec nos’ (sc. ‘imitanda posteris
tulimus '): ‘nobis maiores’ (sc. ‘imitanda
tulerunt ’) seems too harsh and abrupt to
be possible. Joh. Miiller (Beitr. 3. p. 34)
suggests that ‘maiores‘ may have been
the corruption of ‘animorum; ’ ‘certa-
men animorum ’ being, though hardly in
the same sense, a frequent phrase in Livy
(2. 59, 1 ς 4. 56, 9, etc.). For other al-
terations, see Halm, Comm. Crit. and
Baiter on Orelli. ,

4. ex honesto, sc. ‘ortas ‘honourable
rivalries.’

5. fama moderationis parta.. It is
of course be insinuated that he utilised the
credit thus obtained for moderation to
push this request. By associating Drusus
m the tribunitian power, he would be seen
to aim at making the succession to the
principate hereditary.

ingruentia, i. e. those who would
have seized the opportunity, if strict en-

foreement of sumptuary laws had been
enjoined.

6. potestatem tribuniciam, i. e. to be
associated in that power with himself:
cp. 1. 3, 3; Introd. vi. p. 82. On the
coins attesting the possession of this
power by Drusus, see Introd. ii. p. 8.

7. summi fastigii : cp. 13. 17, 53 14.
54, 5, etc.

Augustus repperit. Julius Caesar,
according to Dio (42. 20, 3) had tribu-
nitian power sor lise, ὡς εἰπεῖν, i. e. in sub-
stance without a formal title (‘vocabu—
lum,’ cp. 1. 2, 2, ete). Nor did Au tus
bear the title until 731, B.C. 23, ough
he had in some form held the power long
previously: see Introd. vi. p. 64.

8. ne regis, etc. ι ep. 1. 9. 6. Augus-
tus states (Mon. Ane. Gr. iii. 2-9) that
he refused a formal offer, both of the dic-
tatorship, and of the consulship annually
or for life, in 732, B.C. 18.

9. praemineret. The verb is os post-
Augustan use only, except in Sall. Fr. H.
2. 85 D, 83 K, 50 G; where it takes ιιι
accus. as in the Annals (12. 12, 1: 33,
