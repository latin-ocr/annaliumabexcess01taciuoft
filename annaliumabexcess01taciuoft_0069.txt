⁷⁶ clause, without the addition of magis, as quanto inopina, tanto
maiom ¹·682 5· Cp. ¹·57‚1; 3-5‚4; 4⁶‚4; 4· 48‚5; ⁶·21‚4;
45, a; ra. 11, a. Sometimes comparative and positive are J‘oined, as
; ²⁸ ⁵223 3‘439 ι’

f (3) By the omission of tanto in the apodosis, as quanto in-
cautius efferverat, poenitentia patiens 1. 74, 75 cp. 1. 2, 1; 4. 69, 4;
⁶.19,5; 2⁶, 3. In 3. 8, ι, tam is similarly omitted. The mle of
Ξ· Nipp. (on r. 68, see also Roby 1205), that in all such cases the clause
ζ ao marked is to be taken absolutely, seems hardly to be established.
‘⁴' Dr. ξ 183.

ἓ With these usages may be compared the abbreviation of adversative
ξ sentences by using, after non modo, either sed without etiam, as 1. 60.
ξ 1, etc.; or etiam (or quoque) without sed, as 3. 19, ²5 4. 35, r. This
1 usage is round also in Livy. Dr. ξ 118.

85. ’Πιο omissum or commetiens (asyndeton) is very frequent,
’ either in lively narrative, as inserunt... offerunt . . . intendunt 1. 28, 5 (cp.
η 41, ⁴3 64, 1; 70, 4, etc.); or in enumerations, as senatus magistratuum
i legum 1. a, ¹5 pellerent pellerentur 6. 35, a (cp. 1. 3, 53 35, 1 ; 60, 3,
etc.) 3 or in summing up, as legiones provincias classes, cuncta 1. 9, 6
3v (cp. 1. 68, 73 12. 65, 4, etc.); or to point a climax, as manu voce vul-
} nere a. 17, 5 ; sanie odore contactu 4. 49, 4; tempus preces satias 6.
ὲ 38, 1, etc.; or an antithesis. as lacrimas gaudium questus adulationem
³ 1. 7, a (cp. 4. 49, 3; 60, 3; 6. 19, 3; 15. 27, 4, etc). Such asyndeta
¹ are more or less common in rhetorical writings, as in the orations os
ζ Cioero, in Sallust, Livy, etc. See Ritt. on 11. 6, Nipp. on 4. 43; 12. ¹93
's and a fun account in Dr. ξς 133-138.

06. Tacitus adopts imm Livy, but employa oftener, the conciso Greek
uas ot adverb· aa attributi„ manuvea, as circum 4. 55. 8, etc.;
3 auperne...cominus a. ao, 3, etc. Dr.§ 23, Madv. 301 c, Obs. a.

’ἦ 87. 'rho neqmt naa or tamquam, qusai, and velut, in ax·
τ’ Μυσίὼοιῑῑοεοάοτωιςωοά reaaonorpurpoaeosan aot,
⁷ mre that of be with participles or prepositions (see L. and S. Lex. s. v. .
C. 1. 11), has been very sully analysed by Wolfflin and others (see
'Tg below). 1t would appear that the distinctions which some have attempted
to draw between the force of these words can hardly be sustained; that
ξ the question of reality or pretence is on the whole lest open, though the
ἶζ latter view is not unfrequently suggested by tamquam, and still ostener
’ἡ by quasi or velut ς and that the chief distinction between the two latter is
ς that velut is preferred in the earlier 1111111131, quasi in the Annals. On
