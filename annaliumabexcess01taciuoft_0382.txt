6. 44, 3, etc. The metaphor in ⁶ differre
aliquem rumoribus' (1. 4, 3) appears to
be similar (see note there).

1. paucis familiarium adhibitis. On
the informal, and subsequent formal ern-
ployment of assessors, see Introd. vi. p.
742. hinc, ‘from the other side:’ cp.

‘illic' 1. 70, 6, etc.

ad senatum remittit. This becomes
a technical expression (see Introd. l.1.;
Mommsen, staatsr. ii. p. p.863) If the
princeps d'id not himself take up the case
or ‘remit' it, it seems that it would na-
turally fall through: cp. ‘relationem de
eo Caesar ad senatum non remisit' Pl.
Epp. 9. 13, 22.

4. Illyrico. On the abl. cp. 2, 69,

5. censuissent: cp. 2. 6, 1. 1f the
view given on 2. 62, 1 of the chronology
of these events is correct, ‘priore aestate’
must either be an interpolation (see note
on c. 20, 1), or must be referred to the
summer preceding the decree itself.

7. P. Vinicium. The MS. has ‘ful-
aicium! lt appears plain that the latter
part is a corruption of‘ Vinicium,’ but
there has been much question as to the
proper praenomen. See Baiter, in Orelli
not. crit. The above' 15 adopted by Halm
and N xpp from Borghesi, as on the whole
nearest to the MS., and as the name os the
consul of 755, A. D. 2, who is mentioned
b M. Seneca (Contr. vii. 11, and other
piaces) and L. Seneca (Ep. 40, 9), as an
orator. He was father of the consul of
783, A.D. 30 (Vell. 2. 103, 1). For fur-
ther particulam respecting the family, see
Nipp. 's note.

’ Aeserninum Marcellum, son of the
consul of 732, Β. 0. 22, and, through his
mother Asinia, a grandson of P011i0;
who is said to have regarded him, even

in his-boyhood, as the chief heir of his
own eloquence (M. Sen. Contr. 4. praef.
3). He was curator riparum et alvei
Tiberis, praetor peregrinus (probably m
772, A. D. 19), and cos. 5115111 some un-
known year (see Nipp). In 11. 6, 4, his
name as an orator is coupled with that of Ἴ
Arruntius, and compa red with those of .
Pollio and Messala.
