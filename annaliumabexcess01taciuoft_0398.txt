CORNELII TACITI ANNALIUM [A.U.c. 773.

tationibus subverteretur utque antehac flagitiis, ita tunc legibus

laborabatur.

ea res admonet ut de principiis iuris, et quibuse

modis ad hanc multitudinem infinitam ac varietatem legum per-

ventum sit, altius disseram.

in literature. ‘A rich, childless old man
was a domestic tyrant, and his power in·
creased with his years and infirmities’
(Gibbon, c. 6). See 13. 52, 3; 15. 19,

Friedlander, Sitteng. i. p. 367, foll.

1. periclitantium, ⁸ exposed to prose-
cution:‘ cp. 5. 8, 23 6. 16, 5. Drager
notes the particular application of ‘peri-
culum’ to a lawsuit in Cic. (de Imp.
Pomp. 1, 2, etei).

interpretationibus ‘ construetions‚’
i. e. by straining the technicalities of the
law, to bring all possible cases under it.

2. legibus laborabatur, ‘we were
overburdened with laws.’ With this senti-
ment may be compared that of Livy
(Praef. 9) ‘haec tempora, quibus nec
vitia nostra nec remedia pati possumus.’

3. ea res, ‘this fact (i. e. the oppres-
sive working of this law) suggests a
deeper discussion on the origin of civil
law,’ etc.: ‘ ius,’ as the whole body of
law, is here distinguished from the several
enactments (‘leges'). ⁶ Altius disserere ’
appears to be a new phrase, but analo-
gous to others, as ‘altius exponere' c.
62, 4: see note on 1. 32, 7.

6. vetustissimi mortalium‚etc. The
view here given by Tacitus appears to
be not so much drawn from older poets
(as Ov. Met. 1, 89, etc.), as to be an echo
of the Stoicism of his day. Ἀ similar
picture is drawn by Seneca (Ep. 90), who
explains and comments on Posidonius:
‘Primi mortalium quique ex his geniti
naturam incorruptam sequebantur, eun-
dem habebant et ducem et legem, com-
missi melioris arbitrioz' see also Sall.
Cat. a< With this may be contrasted the
Epicurean view', as set forth in Lucr. 5,

1105-1160, and humorously touched in
a few lines by Horace, ‘Quum prorepse-
runt.’ etc. (Sat. 1. 3, 99, foll.) On the
whole subject of the supposed Law of
Nature, only a reference can here be
given to Sir H. Maine, Ancient Law,
ch. iii, etc.

adhue, ‘up to that time:’ so used,
without any reference to the present, in
e. 42, 3; 4. 23. 1, etc, also in Livy.

8. neque. This answers to ‘et . . .
nihil (equivalent to ‘neque . . . quid uam’)

ε
ξ

. . . vetabantur,’ reward and punis ment,
laws to encourage or infimidate, were .

equally needless.

suopte ingenio. This is generally s
rendered ‘ virtue was sought from (i. e.

from a love for) its own qualities:’ cp. ²
‘camporum suopte ingenio umentinm' 2

(H. 5. 14, 3); also the general use of ᾗ
‘ingenium ’ of inanimate thing-s (6. 41, ι, 'f

etc.), and the apparent reminiscence of

Sallust (Introd. v. 5 97. 1). The diffi-
culty of the ablative has led Nipp. now z
to adopt the other interpretation, ‘by J(
men's own instinct‚’ such a personal sub- ξ
jeet being implied in ‘ peterentur' (cp. j
‘ex se metus’ 2. 38. 6). But such an i
abl. of the objective cause may be justi· ‚²-

fied by examples (ep. Introd. v. 5 30).

10. exui aequalitas: cp. 1.4‚ nand, q
on the historical inf. here, Introd.v. ξ 45 c.
The sense is here no doubt that of the j<
juridical maxim ‘omnes homines natum.
aequales sunt ’ (on which see Maine, Ane. ἶ
Law, ch. iv. p. 92, etc.) Mr. Dallin notes .
that there is probably a special referenoe ·’

to the community of goods which philoso- η’ “

phers (as Sen. Ep. 90, 38-40)‚ no lea -’
than poets (as Verg. G. 1, 125, etc.),
imagined to have existed in the golden

aggedaetia’ the opposite to ⁸ ambitio‚’
as ‘pudor' to ‘visz' cp. 1. 11, 1.
