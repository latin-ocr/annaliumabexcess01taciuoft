ι· of the guiltless;' forming in his mind so painful a contrast to the
of foreign conquests and great domestic struggles which his prede·
oeseors were privileged to unfold ¹. Much indeed that would have been
³ far more interesting to ourselves has thus been sacrificed, but heis at
least entitled to the credit of having adhered steadily to his plan ¹.

,, The apparent inconsistency in the profession of a didactic purpose by
’ᾗ an author who inclines to fatalism, is to be met by showing that the
opinions of Tacitus on this subject are neither so prominent nor so
ἒ definite as to make such inconsistency palpable, and that the saving
clauses in his creed evidently sufficed to prevent his being himself
·,» perplexed by it.

” The principa! passage on the subject does not directly treat of the
j freedom of human action, but raises the question whether prosperity and
ἓ adversity and the chief occurrences of life are due to chance or fate ⁸.
The latter would imply the agency of the gods, who are elsewhere recog·
· ιιίιοά as originators of destiny ⁴, and rulers of man and nature ⁶, sometimes
³ as oaring at least to punish ⁸, if not to protect ⁷, sometimes as those
’ who would bless us if our sins permitted them ⁸, sometimes as pursuing
1 their purpose with sublime indifference to our good deeds or evil’.

ἶ The Epicurean doctrine, that the deity cares for none of us, that good
z or bad are fortunate or unfortunate as blind chance may guide, is briefly
1 dismissed in this passage. In an atheistic form it was no doubt unaccept-
able to Tacitus and to general opinion, though popular enough, as Pliny
ᾗ. has shown ¹⁶, when brought into apparent harmony with religion by the
elasdc theology which worshipped Formae as a goddess ¹¹ and reconciled
, opposites by the apotheosis of a negationi.

The Stoic theory, as stated in the same plaoe, besides repeating the
ς weil-known doctrine, that the good are never really miserable nor the
3 vicked inppy, reconciles destiny and freewill by supposing that after man
