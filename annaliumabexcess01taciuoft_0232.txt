CORNELII TACITI ANNALIUM [A.U.C. 767‘.

ob ferociam quintae et unetvicensimae legionum, sexagensimum
apud lapidem (loco Vetera nomen est) hibernantium. nam primi 2
seditionem coeptaverant: atrocissimum quodque facinus horum
manibus patratum; nec poena commilitonum exterriti nec pae-

igitur Caesar arma classem8

socios demittere Rheno parat, si imperium detrectetur, bello

certaturus.

46. At Romae nondum cognito, qui fuisset exitus in Illyrico, 1
et legionum Germanicarum motu audito, trepida civitas incusare
Tiberium quod, dum patres et plebem, invalida et inermia,
cunctatione ficta ludificetur, dissideat interim miles neque du-
orum adulescentium nondum adulta auctoritate comprimi queat.
ire ipsum et opponere maiestatem imperatoriam debuisse ces- 2
suris, ubi principem longa experientia eundemque severitatis

This use of the word had been already
adopted by Livy (25. 11, 18) from Vergil
(Aen. 1, 33, etc.).

1. quintae et unetvicensimae. On

Ι the departure of these legions from the

summer camp, cp. c. 37, 3.

2. Vetera. This station, though here
described as if unknown to the reader,
had been frequently mentioned in the
¹ Histofies! The full name, ‘Vetera
castra,’ is given in H. 4. 21, 13 5. 14, 1.
The locality is identified by geographers
with that of Birten, near Xanten, between
Cleves and Wesel. This would well suit
the distance (sixty Roman miles) if reek·
oned from Koln. The Itinerary of Ant-o-
ninus (p. 370, cited by Orelli), placing it
at a distance of sixty-three ‘millia
sus’ from Bonn, cannot be correct, if
⁴ Vetera' be placed at Xanten. See note
on c. 39, 1.

3. primi coeptaverant: see c. 31, 3:
litgr-1uxiriffl’mrliigvl th} agvfiirthsglssssiepognfi
may be taken (with N ipp ) to mean their
own penitence.

5. arma. This is osten used for‘ mi-
lites‚’ as in c. 1, 3, etc. Here the legions
especially are meant, as the‘ soeii’ are
mentioned separately.

. classem. This was perhaps a flo-

tilla temporarily got together for use on
the river. It is known. however, that a
standing German fleet of seagoing ships
existedg in the time of Drusus (Flor. 4.
12, 26; Suet. Cl. 1), and was employed
in 758. ΑΛ). 5, by Tiberius, who carried
it to the Elbe (vell. 2. 106, 2), and even

to the Cimbri, or Jutland (Mon. Anc. 5.
14). Germanicus also used (c. 60, 3) and
augmented it (2. 6, 2). It is styled in in-
scriptions ‘Classis Germanica’ (or ‘Au-
gusta Germanica ’) P. F. (‘ pia fidelis·):
see Orelli 36oo; Henzen 6865-6867.

8. Illyrico. This is often not dis-
tinguished from Pannonia: see c. 52. 3.

10. invalida et inermia, ‘the feeble
and defenceless element: ’ cp. ‘quod im-
becillum aetate‚' etc. (c. 56, 3). Nipp.
has here collected many instances from
Tacitus of the substantival application
of neuter adjectives to masc. or fem.
substantives, to denote them as beings, or
things, of a certain class It is not how-
ever peculiar to him, but a classical usage :

pas< see Madv. 211 b, Obs. 1.

11. cunctatione: see c. 11, etc.

dissideat, ‘mutiniesz' cp. ‘discors’
c. 38, 1, etc.

1 2. adulescentium. Germanicus was
twenty-nine, Drusus probably about
twenty—six, years old. See Introd. ix. note·
305 3¹·

13. opponere, ‘ to confront them with:

cessuris: cp. ‘tracturis ' c. 31, 1.

14. experientia: cp. c. 4, 3.

severitatis et munificentiae sum-
mum, ‘ with sovereign power to
punish and reward.’ ‘ Severitas,' though
apparently used differently in c. 25,
35 36, 3, has certainly thss force in
3. 21, 2, etc. On the genitive, see In-
trod. v. 5 33, e, γ. The words might
also be taken, with Zumpt (447, n. 1),
like ‘praestantissimus sapientiae ' (6. 6,
2), to mean ‘severitatis et munificentiae
