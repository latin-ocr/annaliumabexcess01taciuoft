would imply that she was a fifth dajugliter,
but she seems to belong to a later genera-
tion* than the five daughters of App.
Claudius Caecus. Her statue was placed
in the temple of the Mater Deum to
commemorate the story told of her draw—
ing the ship off a sandbank. when the
goddess was brought to Rome in 550,
{aiii-‚ci ‘3‘3'21312‘3 {23³ 5135333012223‘30353}
the names ‘Matri Deum et Navi Sal-
viae’ (see C. 1. L. vi. 1, 492—4)‚ which
has been taken by some to imply a dei-
fication of Claudia under the title of
‘Navisalvia,’ may perhaps suggest an
origin for the story.

1. bis elapsam. The temple in which
it stood, dedicated in 563, Β. c. 191 (Liv.
36. 36, 3), on the Palatine‚ had been
burned in 643 and 756, ac. 111, A.D. 3,
and the flames are said on each occasion
to have stopped short of the statue (Val.
Max. 1. 8, 11). The sentence would more
naturally have run ‘ statuam apud aedem
. . . consecratam, vim ignium bis elap-
sam! Borghesi (2, 183) notes that the
statue is represented upon coins.

3. caerimoniam: cp. 3. 61, 3. sse
sanctity of the ‘Caelius mons ² would be
increased by calling 't ‘ Augustus.'

5. Haud fuerit· a surdum. A similar
antiquarian note is introducedswith almost
the same words of apology. in 12. 24, 1.

6. cognomento=⁶nomine:’ see note
on 1. 23, 6; 2. 6, 5, etc.; so also ‘vo-
eabulo’ below (cp. 1. 23, 4).. No other
genltion appears of this old name os the

ae ian.

frequens, nowhere else with genitive,
but here accommodated to the construe-
tion οἱ ¹ feeundus’ (Dra-ger).

7. appellitatum, This verb is found -
here only in Tacitus, who seems to take
it from the s ch of Claudius (col. ’
i. 22), which is version of the story
follows. ·

Caele Vibenna. Varro (L.L. 5, 46) λ
and Dion. Hal. (2. 36) represent this per· =
son (with some differences osorthography)
as an ally of Romulus against Tatius.
In the speech of Claudius (col. i. 17, ’
sqq. : see Appendix to B. xi.). Servius Tul·
lius or Mastarna is spoken osas migra- ⁴
ting from Etruria and settling on this ᾗ
hill, and naming it after Caelius Vivenna, j
his old captain in arms. Livy, who
makes no mention of this legend, says
that the Caelian was assigned by Tullus '.'
Hostilius to the people transponed from ”
Alba (1. 30, 1). - ᾗ

8. portaujsset. The MS. has ‘auxi- ,ς

the previous ‘appellitatum‘ and the api—„J

Dion. Hal. 3, 1), and Ancus Marcius (cie,
