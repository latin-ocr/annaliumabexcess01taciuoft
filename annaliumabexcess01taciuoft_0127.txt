'with them that we find both rewarded with the ‘ civitas’ aster twenty-six
g years* service ¹. The ships are usually either ‘ triremes ' or ‘ Liburnae ¹,'

and are distinguished by names like modern ships ⁸. The captains,
ἴ whether of triremes or Liburnians, are designated as ‘ trierarchi ⁴.' We
³ have no knowledge os the strength of these fleets; which are little men·

The total strength os all these forces can be only very roughly esti-
mated. Taking the legion with its auxiliaries at 10,ooo‚ we have a total
of ²50,ooo for the main armies ; to which the home army, the ‘clas-

roo‚ooo. This it should be remembered represents at that time the

of territet-ies, but sn organized whole ⁸. The administration, especially

rapidity to inter-communication: and, not to speak os his periodical
nunciat statements ¹¹, his summary os the whole position os the empire,
published aster his death ¹¹, must have given to the senate a new insight

, into its organintion. ts, beyond this, neither he nor his successor had
‘ devised any pians for bringing the whole mass into a condition of homo-
ζ geneous unit„ it is none tbe less evident that tendencies in this direction
