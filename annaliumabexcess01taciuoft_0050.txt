32 INTRODUCTION.

natural gifts‚ not unmixed with the natural defects, of the most finished
pleader of an age which required above all that its orators should be
terse‚ brilliant, and striking.

Historical style was all the more likely to be rhetorical, owing to the
custom of oral recitation. From many instances in which the effect
on the ear seems to be studied, and others in which oral emphasis
would have removed an ambiguity, it is not improbable that Tacitus
may have adopted this general practice.

To these should be added the most truly personal of all his traits
of style, the elevation and dignity (σεμνότης) known to have characterised
the orator ¹, and which, in the relation uot only of great matters, but
also of what is trivial, or even revolting, appears never to be lost sight
of by the historian.

The following instances are almost wholly restricted to the Annals,
not only on account of the limits of the present treatise, but also
because these are the most truly Tacitean of all the writings of Tacitus 3
many uses and expressions, rare or even unknown in his earlier works,
being in them frequent and even habitual’.

The arrangement of Draga, whose sections are cited throughout,
is 'far more elaborate and scientific than that here given, which has
been simplified for convenience of general reference. It will be evident
that many obligations are also due throughout to the Grammars of
Zumpt, Madvig, Kennedy, and Roby‚ especially the last.

SVNTAX.

Ι. Nouus and Pronouns.
A. Sunsmnrxvns.

1. Abstract Nouns. The use of such in the plural is hardly more
frequent in Tacitus than in Cicero or Livy, but is extended to new
instances, such as aemulatus (ἅπ. εἷρ.) 13. 46, 63 dignationes (ὄπ. εἷρ.)
2. 33, 53 and to such as are elsewhere very rare, as infamiae-(Plauss)
4. 33, 4; simulationes (Pl. min.) 5. 54, 2; 6. 45, 6, etc.

His use of abstract for concrete is somewhat more characteristic:
as amicitia=‘friends,' 2. 27, 2 ς 77, Ῑ; consilia=‘advisers,’ 4. 40, 2;
iura=‘charters‚' (ἅπ. etp.) 3. 60, 45 liberalitas=‘gift,’ 2. 37, 2, etc.; ·

s matrimonia=‘wives,' 2. 13, 33 origo=‘ancestor,' (Verg.) 4. 9, 3, etc. ;

regna=‘kings‚’ (Stat.) -3. 55, 3. Dr. ξ 2. 3.

² This has been very sully shown by low, ξς 22 b, 31, 36, 37, 40, 64, 69,77, 89.
