3³⁹1&- titles assigned to the two greater works require some remark.
the second Medicean MS„ both ‘Annals' and ‘Histories,’ without
,ἶῗῖ- · distinguishing title, are numbered continuously as the ‘ Books of
melius Tacitus? The latter, however, are called ‘ Historiae' by
ᾗ ⁸⁶·- ¹, and are definitely cited, as a separate work under that title,
<by Tenunian ¹.
For the title ‘Annales’ there is no real authority. Tacitus does
hdeed, in one place, speak os his work as ‘ Annales nostri ⁸,’ and,
lin another, of his general purpose to relate events in their chrono-
ι, ν order ⁴. But there is no evidence that he intended the title
“’Ἑξείηςῐίνείγ sor this work; and he elsewhere uses ‘ annales ' as a general
sor ‘history ⁸.' It is with equal generality that Jornandes speaks
fos him as ‘annalium scriptor ⁸.' In the first Medicean MS. the books
are entitled ‘ab excessu Augusti: a title analogous to that of the
*Histories of Livy, ‘ ab urbe condita!
j of the manuscripts, it will be sufficient here to notice the first
'‘Medic-an, comprising only the books contained in this volume and
&forming the sole authority sor them “’.
-’ » Ruodolphus, a learned moult of Fulda in Hesse Cassel, writing in
ζ the ninth century, cites Tacitus as speaking os the Visurgis, and would
y therefore appear to have known a manuscript containing these books ⁸.

οη a communication made to him from Germany, respecting some
’ unknown vorke os Tacitus said to be preserved at Hersseld, near
Fulda. Nothing further is known till 1509, by which time the MS.
