CONSTJTUTJON OF THE EARLV PRJNCJPA TE. 77

 

[l aedile and tribune, though one or other seems usually to have formed

part of the ‘cursus honorum ¹,' had so sar fallen into disrepute‚ that

* properly qualified candidates were apt to be wanting ¹. The lesser
magistracies, held before the quaestorship, and often collectively desig-
nated as the ‘ vigintiviratus ⁸,' consisted of four separate boards. (1) The

ᾖ ‘tresviri capitales' were still charged with the duty os executing capital
sentences, buming books, etc-⁴3 but their summary jurisdiction at the
Moenian column⁸ had probably wholly or mainly passed to the prae·
fectus urbis. (a) The ‘ tresviri monetales,’ or ‘tresviri aere argento auro
flando feriundo' must have had their office restricted to the copper
coinage still struck by the senate. Their names disappear from the
coinage from and aster the later years of Augustus ⁸. (3) The ⁴ quatuor·
viri viis in urbe purgandis' appear to have been subordinate officers to
the aediles ⁷. (4) The ‘decemviri stlitibus iudicandisf a very old separate
boatd. became now presidents oi the centumviml courts ⁸. It is evident
that all these greater and lesser magistracies filled considerable depart-
ments of the home govemment; and it is also known that the con·
current, and, ultimately, encroaching functions of Caesar's ‘praefecti'
began by being sar less than they ultimately became ⁸.

J Tlms the two classes os magistrates coexisted3 and a similar duality
pervades the whole government. We have the two classes of provincial
governments; the senatorial proconsuls, appointed by lot, with annual
teum-eg and Caesar's legati, specially designated, and continuing during
his pleasure. There are two Judicial systems; on one side the consular-
senatorial high court, the tribunals os the praetor and iudices, and os the
centumviri: on the other, the persona} court os the princeps and those
of his delegates. There are two treasuries, each of which receives and

r expende public money; even two coinages, as the princeps coins gold

aad silva, and the senate copper¹⁰.
ln sorne departmentsr indeed, of the thus divided governrnent the

senate has, in outward show, more even than its old constitutional
power. ln form, since the abolition of the comitia, it elects the magis·
uates oi the state, who, through such election‚ themselves become
