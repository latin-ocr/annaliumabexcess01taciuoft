CORNELII TA CJTJ A'NNALJUM [A. u. e. 7⁷⁴·-

quod fictis maiestatis criminibus Magium Caecilianum praetorem

petivissent, auctore principe ac decreto senatus puniti.

utrum· 2

que in laudem Drusi trahebatur: ab eo in urbe, inter coetus et

sermones hominum obversante, secreta patris mitigari.

5 luxus in iuvene adeo displicebat: huc potius intenderet, diem
aedificationibus, noctem conviviis traheret, quam solus et nullis
voluptatibus avocatus maestam vigilantiam et malas curas exer*

ceret.

38. Non enim Tiberius, non accusatores fatiscebant. et An-1
10 charius Priscus Caesium Cordum pro consule Cretae postulaverat
repetundis, addito maiestatis crimine, quod tum omnium accusa-

tionum complementum erat.

2. auctore principe ac decreto se-
natus. Ablatives of different kinds are
thus. coupled in 1. 55, 1 (whence see
Nipp.), and below, c. 39, 2.

utrumque, i.e. both the punishment
of Annia Rufilla (c. 36, 4) and the mis-
sive from his father against these per-
sons, presumed to have been procured by
his influence.

4. secreta patris mitigari, ‘the soli—
tary plans of his father were made less

crueL’ Nipp. compares ‘secretum‘ in
Agr. 22, 53 39, 3; P1.Pan. 53.
5. huc . . . intenderet, ‘he had

1.
’ 6. aedificationibus. To explain this
we must suppose that Drusus, in contrast
to the parsimony of Tiberius (6. 45, ι),
had a passion sor building, probably sor
the erection of such mansions as were a
leading extravagance of the age (cp. c.
53, 5; Hor. Od. 3. 1, 33-37; Vell. 2. 33,
2132‘3100 ’ἆᾶιῖἒὲἰῖἓηῗῖς 3333.. pggngggg
passion, but describe him as addicted to
pantomimes (Dio, 57.14‚10); whence it
has been thought that Tacitus may have
written ‘ludicris sactionibus‚' or may
have invented such a plural as‘ ludifica-
tionibus’ or ‘laetificationibus’ Lips. reads
&editionibus ' referring to the propensity
noted‘ ιιι 1. 76, 5, but this word does not
seem able to stand by itself sor‘ gladia-
torial exhibitions,' nor ‘agitationibus’
(Urlichs) by itself sor‘ driving?

conviviis. He is described as μέθῃ
κατακορής (Dio, l.1..)

traherett so Halm and Nipp., etc.,
after Lips. for the MS. ‘ trahere,' which
is retained by Orelli, and might be taken

cp. 2.

Caesar Antistium Veterem e2

as an explanatory infinitive following on
‘ huc.’ Φ

7. malas, ‘pernicious‚‘ illustrated by
‘non enim, ’et.c sollo

9 fatiscebant, ‘were becoming ex- '
hausted:' soin6. 7, 6; 14. 24, ις 16. 5,

1, etc. The sense is a metaphor from the
literal meaning found in Vergil (G 1,
180, etc.).

et: see note on π. 50, 1.

Ancharius Primus. Borghes1 (v 307)
thinks from the sumame that he was of
municipal origin, akin to a T. Ancharius
T. f. Pal(atina) Priscus, recorded in an
inscription at Pisaurum (Pesaro). The
‘gens Ancharia‘ at Rome has no cog-
nomen.

10. Cretae. This island had been con-
stituted into a province by Q. Caecilius
Metellus Creticus in 687,1³.c.67(Ve11..
2. 34). It was now combined with Cyrene ,
(seec. 70, 1) intoasenatorial province,
verned by proconsuls of praetorianum ιιιιιξο- j

postulaverat. The result of this ac- j
cusation is given in c. 70, 1. No abl. of 3
this kind ις used elsewhere with this verb ¹
except such a general term as ‘crimine’ ⁷·
(Apul. Met. 3. 6, ι83; 7. 3, 45ο); and
the nearest parallel is ‘damnatus repe-1
‘tundis‘ (Suet. Oth. 2). Elsewhere the {³
verb is used by Tacitus with gen. (as 1.
74,1,etc.,) and by Cicero with ‘.'de
which Nipp. inserts here..

12 complementum, ‘the makeweig ht.’ <³
The same expression is cited from Cod. ἓ
Th. 9. 24, 3. Elsewhere the word occur!
only in Cic Or. 69, ²30 “inania . . .
verba . . . quasi complementa numero·
rum). ’ On the frequent addition of this ²
charge to others, cp. 2. 50, 1; c. 22, ³3
67, 3, etc. A similar rhetorical exaggera·- ,
