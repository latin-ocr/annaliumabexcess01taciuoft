58 INTRODUCTION.

IV. The Study of Variety in Expression. ’

85. Besides aiming at novelty through the introduction or adoption of
unfamiliar words or senses of words (see ἐξ 69-7 2), Tacitus constantly
seeks to avoid monotony by varying forms of the same word.
Thus Artaxata is twice feminine, five times neuter (see on 2. 56, 3);
Tigranocerta four times used in each form (see 14. 24, 6): the form
Vologeses is sometimes changed to Vologesus (13. 37, 1). So also we
have alioqui and alioquin, anteire and antire, balneae and balneum;
dein and deinde ; grates and gratias agere, inermis and inermus;
senecta and senectus, etc. In many other cases such variations have

been treated by editors as errors of copyists. See Wolfflin, Philol. 25,
99-106; 121-127.

86. Names often mentioned are varied. Thus we have Gallus,
Asinius Gallus, and Gallus Asinius, etc.; or the cognomen alone
repeated, when the name has been given more fully above, as Trionis
2. 28, 4; Lepida 12. 64, 5, etc. ; also the names of relatives mentioned
together are often varied, as hunc [Gracchum] pater Sempronius . . ,tulerat
4. 13, 4 ; pater Scriboniani Camillus 12. 52, 2 ; Crispum.. . C. Sallustius
3. 30, 3 ς Valerius Messala, cuius proavum ...Corvinum 13. 34, 1, etc.
Nipp. on 4. 13, Joh. Miiller‚ 4, p. 15, 16:

87. Propositions with similar meanings are often inter-changed,
as in...ad 1. 28, 7, etc.; inter... apud 3. 40, 13 in. ..apud6.22‚ 2 ;
per. . . in 4. 55, 7, etc. Several such instances are found in Livy, few in
other works of Tacitus than the Annals. Dr. ξ 104.

88. cases with propositione are interchanged with simple
cases: as for instance a dat. with accus. after ad or in3 e. g. with oppor-
tunus 2. 6, 4 ; promptus 4. 46, 4,· referre 14. 38, 5 ; and such an accus.
with gerundive dat. 2. 37, 6 ; see also ξ 62. Dr. ξ 105.

89. copulative conjunctione are constantly varied in different
clauses, especially in the Annals, sometimes no doubt to graduate the
connexion (see on 1. 1, 5), but at other times apparently for elegance.
Cp.the changeofet and ac 4. 26‚4; ac .. . que . .. et 15. 25, 6; que.. .et
.. .et. . .ac 2. 60, 4. See Dr. ξ 115, Nipp. on 4. 3.

90. After asyndeta (see ξ 65) conjunctione are introducam as
classes regna provinciae. . . aut. . . et. ..ac 1. 11, 6 ; illustres ignobiles
dispersi aut aggerati 6. 19, 33 see also 12. 64, 33 15. 26, 1. Dr. § 140, ’
Nipp. on 1. 113 2. 81. Here again different degrees of connexion are ³
often intended to be expressed.
