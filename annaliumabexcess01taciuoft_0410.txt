and may have meant to glauce at her
conduct (1. 69, 2). On the dative ‘de-
cursu,' cp. c. 30, 4,

2. plura. uxoribus obiectari. Prior
to this date, no other instance but that of
Plancina seems to be known to us. After·
wards the case of Sosia (4. 1 ‚ 4) may be
cited, also those of Paxaea (69. 29.1 ; Dio,
58. 24, 3), of Cornelia, wife of Calvisius
Sabinus (Dio, 59. 18, 4), and of the wife
of Classicus (Pl. Epp. 3. 9, 19). Juvenal
also (8, 128) pictures the govemor's wife
hovering as a harpy over provincial towns.

⁷ 4. negotia, especially (as Nipp. notes)
such transactions as the prosecutor on a
charge of ‘ repetundae ’ would cite.
duorum egressus, etc„ ‘there were
two to be escorted to public places, two
centres os government.’ ⁶ Praetorium’ is
the regular term for the governor's resi-
dence (as in N. T. ete), and hence used
of other mansions: see Prof. Mayor on

imperious than those of their husbands.

6. Oppiis, the plural, here and in c. 34,
6, is probably to be taken as rhetorical
(cp. 1. 10, 3). The ‘ lex Oppia,’ restrain-
ing the ornaments, dress, and vehicles of

in spite of the vehement protest of Cato,
represented in a speech by Livy (34. 1-8):
see also Val. Max. 9. 1, 3.

alii83 as for instance the ‘ lex Vo-
conia,' limiting the right of women to

appears to have been very inoperative·

8. obturbabant, ‘were interrupting'
(cp. 6. 24, 4), with such remarks as follow.

neque relatum: see c. 33, 1.

10. censorem, used invidiously; the
only censoria] sunctions being now vested
in Caesar. Tiberius himself says (2. 33,
6) ‘non id tempus censurae.‘

Valerius Messalinus: see on 1. 8, 5.

Messalla. M. Valerius M. f. M. n. Mes-
salla Corvinus, the celebrated orator and
friend of Horace, Ovid, and Tibullus,
was born in 695, B.c. 59,was consul with
Caesar in the year of Actium, and died
about 764, A. D. 11. On his ‘ praefectura
urbis: see 6. 11, 5.

attempts to emend by insertion of a
preposition. We have a genitive depend-

11. 33, 2, etc.

12. in melius . . . mutata. Here and
in 14. 43, 1 (‘deterius mutari ’) ‘in’ has
been generally inserted by editors. Pfitz-
ner (p. 106), noting that ⁶

1. 47, 3, considers that the MS. readings
may stand in these places, as analogous
to ‘bene mutari '. in c. 44, 3. Here, how-
ever, the result of the change seems to be
distinctly expressed, and the preposition to
be required, as in c. 54, 9, etc.

obsideri bellis, ‘ had war at its gates?
