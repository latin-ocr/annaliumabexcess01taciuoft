242 CORNELII TACITI ANNALIUM [A.U.C. ⁶4⁶⁸*

nihil relictum imperatoribus, ubi femina manipulos intervisat‚5
signa adeat, largitionem temptet, tamquam parum ambitiose
filium ducis gregali habitu circumferat Caesaremque Caligulam
appellari velit. potiorem iam apud exercitus Agrippinam quam 8

men principis obsistere non quiverit. accendebat haec onerabat· ‘1
que Seianus, peritia morum Tiberii odia in longum iaciens, quae
reconderet auctaque promeret.
70. At Germanicus legionum, quas navibus vexerat, secundam 1
10 et quartam decumam itinere terrestri P. Vitellio ducendas tradit,
quo levior classis vadoso mari innaret vel reciproco sideret.
Vitellius primum iter sicca humo aut modice adlabente aest'ua
quietum habuit : mox inpulsu aquilonis, simul sidere aequinoctii,
quo maxime tumescit Oceanus, rapi agique agmen. et opple-,3

the time mentioned in c. 60, 3.

or ⁴ savorem ' (Ritter), as well as that of
10. P. Vitellio, an uncle of the subse· -

the text (adopted by Halm from Doe-

derlein, and, aster ‘militum,' by Heraeush
all can be supported by references to Ta-
citus, the latter by the most numerous:
cp. 2. 5, ²5 3. 12, 6; H. 1. 23, 1; 64, 4.

2. tamquam parum ambitiose =
‘tamquam non satis ambitiose,' ‘as if she
did not court them enough by ' etc. On
the ‘gregalis habitus‚’ cp. c. 41, 3.

5. conpressam seditionem, an in-
vidious exaggeration of the facts men-
tioned c. 40, 4¹·

nomen principis, probably alluding
to* their treatment of the letters writ-
ten ‘nomine principis ' c. 36, 4.

6. accendebat haee: cp. ‘incendebat
haec? c. 23, 1.

onerabat: cp. c. 19, 2, etc.

“’ 7. odia in longum imisue, ‘ sowing

seeds ofjealousy for a distant future.’ A

similar metaphor, less boldly expressed, is

‘6suturis . . . caedibus semina iaciebantur ’
. 47, 1.

quae reconderet, etc„ ‘ sor him to bury
and bring to light with increase.' These
words explain ‘in longum‚’ and describe

' the same trait in Tiberius which is men·

tioned in c. 7, 113 3. 64, 23 4. 71, 5.

9. At Germanicus, etc. This narra-
tive is taken up from the end of the move-
,ment described by ‘reducto ad Amisiam
exercitu (e. 63, 5), and the tense of ‘vex-
erat ’ (used sor ‘ advexerat,’ as ‘ vectum ’
for ‘advectum’ 11. 14, 2) is referred to

quent emperor, who is often mentioned as
with Germanicus, and as an accuser of
Cn. Piso (see 2. 6, 1; 74, 2 ; 3.10. 2 ; 13.
3; 17, 43 19, 1). He is thought (see
Nipp. on 2. 74) to have been procos. of
Bithynia in 771, Α. D. 18: on is death,
see 5. 8. ι

11. vadoso mari3 that off the coast
near the mouth of the Ems.

reciproco sideret, ‘ground less
heavily at ebb-tide‚’ i. e. sooner get afloat
again after grounding. ‘Reciprocus’ has
this sense frequently in Pl. N. H.; and
‘ sido ’ is thus used in 2. 6, 2, and in Livy
and poets

13. inpulsu. This abl. might be instru-
mental, but being here coordinate with
‘ sidere,' is probably to be taken as musal.

sidere aequinoctii; ⁴ sidus' is used

of the season of the year by Vergil, ’111- .—

berno moliris sidere classem ’ (Aen. ,4,
309). The autumna] equinox is of course
meant. and a date of the conclusion of
this campaign thus supplied.

14. rapi agique, ‘lose footing and are
swept away.’ W'alther thus distinguishes
these nearly synonymous words.

16. brevia.. This poetical term (Verg-
Aen. 1, 1 1 1 ; Luc. 9, 338), taken apparently
from the Greek βραχέα (Hdt., Thue. etc.),
is used in prose by Tacitus alone. Cp. 6.
33, 5 ; also ¹ breve et 'incertum ’ 14. 29, 3.

sternuntur ς sc. ‘ homines,’ supplied
