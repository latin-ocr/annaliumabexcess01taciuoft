CORNELII TACITI ANNALJUM [A.U.C. 772.

cerni, et satis inlustre, si veteres inter scriptores haberetur.

sepulchrum, a cenotaph. The place
would be in the sorum ofAntioch (c. 7 3, 5).

1. tribunal. It has been thought that
this would commemorate his imperium
(Walther), or provincial jurisdiction (cp.
c. 57, 4). Nipp. thinks it took the form
of a scaffold or bier, to represent that on
which the body was laid out; such a
memorial tribunal, erected by one who
appears to have held no such ⁴ imperium,’
being recorded in an inscription <Orelli
4548). Words relating to these memorials
appear traceable in the inscription (F ragm.
a. 17-19).

Epidaphnae. This famous grove
and sanctuary of Apollo, described by
Gibbon (c. 2 3), was really called Δάφνη,
and gave to this Antioch its distinguish-
ing title, ἐπὶ Δάφνῃ, or ‘Antiochia Epi—
daphnes’ (Pl. N. H. 5. 21, 18, 79). It
was really five miles from Antioch‚ but
considered a suburb of it.

. 2. coleretur. Halm and Nipp. adhere
to this old correction, on the ground that
the MS. ‘colerentur’ would appear to
imply that the places where statues were
honoured might be other than those in
which they stood. The ‘cultus' would
probably be that of his ‘ Dii Manes ’ (see
note on c. 7, 3).

numerum inierit, ‘ could enumerate: ’
(ἐξ). 15. 4333.. The phrase is so used by

aes. an iv.

3. clipeus, ‘a medallion bust.' Pliny
(N. H. 35. 3. 3, 12) says that such ·had
been set up at Rome from the consulship
of Appius Claudius in 259, 13.c. 495. An
‘imago clipeata’ οξ Cicero, not appar-
ently in bronze, but marble, is engraved
in Visconfi, Ic. Rom. pl. xii. Orelli refers
also to other specimens. ⁴
„2321”ssssAE “ffffiffi‘ziffi'ssurgaffeffi
have been set up in the Palatine library t cp.
c.37, 3. Germanicus is recorded to have
pleaded causes from a date before the
exile of ovid (Fasti 1, 21), until after his
triumph (Suet. Cal. 3); and the above
authors, as well as Pliny (N. H. 8. 42, 64,

155), speak of him also as a poet; but
the authorship of the translation of Aratus
and other remains ascribed to him is
matter of question.

solitum paremque, ¹ of the usual
material’ (bronze) ‘ and size3' as opposed
to one ‘ auro et magnitudine insignis!

85. dicaturum, sc. ‘se:' cp. Introd. v,

fortuna: cp. c. 71, 6.

7. cuneum. The military sense of
this word (1. 51, 1) is not applicable to
‘ equites ε ’ we must therefore suppose one
os the wedge-shaped divisions of the
‘ quatuordecim ordines ’ iu the theatre to
be here meant (cp. Suet. Dom. 4). ‘rheae
sourteen rows were apparently divided
into cunei ‘seniorum' and ‘iuniorum ‘
(Marquardt‚ Hist. Eq. Rom. p. 71). This
honour was paid to Germanicus ashaving
been ‘princeps iuventutis‘ (Ov. ex P. 2.
5, 41); on which title, see 1. 3, 2, etc.

8. turmae. The centuries of ‘equites
Romani equo publico' (on whom see
Introd. vii. p. 873 Mommsen, Staatsr. ii.

p. 381, foll. ; Seeley, Hist. Exam. of Livy. i
B. I. p. 73, 79 soll.) appear to have been j

arranged at their ‘ transvectio ' (see below)

into six ‘turmae ’ each commanded by a ⁷:
‘sevir:’ see Insc.Orell. 30433 Henzen6412. j

idibus Iuliis. On July ¹5 took place

the review or ‘ transvectio equitum,’ when ,

Dionys. Hal. (6. 13, 1069) describes them ,
as riding in a procession os about 5000, Δ
dressed in the ‘ trabea ’ and crowned with
olive, in commemoration of the sup· “
posed appearance of the Dioscuri atssthe
battle of lake Regillus. The institution j
is said to date from 450, Β. c. 304 (Liv. 9. ,ῖ
46, 15), and to have been revived by An⁴ .
gustus aster long disuse (Suet. Aug. 38). ῑκ

imaginem . . . sequerentur. This ἐ
again would be in recognition os his
having led the procession as ‘princeps
iuventutis.¹ Cp.⁴ the figure of speech in ‚
5. 4, 5 ‘quorum imagines pro vexillis '5
secuti forent! The decree respecting
Drusus contains words apparently ordain- j
ing a similar honour to him. ³
