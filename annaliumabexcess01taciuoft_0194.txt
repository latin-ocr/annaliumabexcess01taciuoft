CORNELII TACITI ANNALIUM [A.U.C. 567.

quippe Augustus supremis sermo· 2

nibus cum tractaret, quinam adipisci principem locum suffecturi
(s abnuerent aut inpares vellent vel idem possent cuperentque,
M’. Lepidum dixerat capacem sed aspernantem, Gallum Asinium
5 avidum et minorem, L. Arruntium non indignum et, si casus
daretur, ausurum. de prioribus consentitur, pro Arruntio quidam 3
Cn. Pisonem tradidere; omnesque praeter Lepidum variis mox
criminibus, struente Tiberi0,circumventi sunt. etiam Q. Haterius 4
et Mamercus Scaurus suspicacem animum perstrinxere, Haterius
cum dixisset ‘quousque patieris, Caesar, non adesse caput rei

‘inlustres domi artes ' 4. 6, 2 ς also 3. 70,
1; 12. 6, 2; 14. 55, 6. In 6. 7, 1 he
speaks of the ‘ sanctissimae artes' of
Anuntius; in 11. 6, 4, a speaker mentions
his ‘incorrupta vita et facundia,‘ classing
him even with Pollio and Messala.
Seneca, however, if he refers to this
Arruntius (see above), considers the style
of his History of the Punic wars an exag-
geration of the mannetisms os Sallust.

pari· fama publice, ‘ with corres-
ponding public reputation.' ‘ Publice ' is
best taken, with Ruperti, as ---‘iudicio
omnium.'

2. principem, adjective, as 3. 75, 13
4. 38, 1 ; 60, 4, etc. On the frequent use
by Tacitu6s of such adjectival substantives,
see c. , .

suff9eeturi is best taken absolutely,
asin G. 13, 1: Dial. 37, ι, etc.: so as to
leave ‘adipisci' dependent only on the
verbs: though ‘sufficere’ takes an in-
finitive in Verg. Aen. 5, 22.

3. vel certainly stands sometimoe in
Tacitus for ‘aut' as 13. 41, 3; 14. 35, 5.
etc.; but here Nipp. appears rightly to
show that, as in 14. 3, 1 (‘ in hortos aut
Tusculanum vel Antiatem in agrum '), he
is ‘not so much contrasting three classes
with each other, as two of them with
a third; those who, with or without
capacity, would desire the position, with
those who would not.

4. M’. Lepidum. This praenomen is
-given in full, 3. 22, 2. 'Elsewhere the MS.
always reads M.. thus consusing this

1 Lepidus with another, whose praenomen

‘Marcus ⁸ is written sull in 3. 32, 2 (where
see notes). On Manius Lepidus see further
3. 35, 1; 50, 1 ξ 4. 20‚-3; 56, 35 6.27‚ 4.
He was consul in 764, Α. D. 11.

5. et is a variation for the preceding
‘ sed,’ and often stands for an adversative
particle. ‚where the words sufficiently

convey the opposition, as ‘ turbidos et
nihil ausos’ c. 38, 4. Cp. 12. 52, 3: 14.
65, 2 ; and ‘ neque ¹ (= ‘ sed non ’) 6. 37. 3.

casua, ¹ opportunity ; ² so 11. 9, 1 ι
12. 28, 1; 50, 1; 13. 36, 2: chiefly from
Sall.‚ e. g. Jug. 25, 9. etc.

7. On. Pisonem: see c. 74, 65 2. 43,

‚ etc.

3 omnes. This should apply to all
the other three; but the absurdity of
supposing that Tiberius eontn'ved the fall
of Piso makes Nipp. contend that the re·
mark about him is parenthetical, and that
only two out of the three originally men-
tioned are referred to. In ang case
Tacitus oversteps his own facts, for
Tiberius is admitted to have been prob·
ably not cognisant of the charge against
Arruntius (6. 47, 4); so that ⁸ omnes ¹ and
‘ mox' are justified only by the fate of
Gallus some sixteen years later, on which
see note on 6. 2 3, 1. -

8. Q. Haterius. a consular (2. 33, 1),
probably cos. suff. in 745, B.c. 9 (Borg-
hesi) ; a man of servile disposition (3. 57,
3), and a fluent but careless speaker (4.
61, 2). On his probable marriage with a
daughter of Agrippa, see Introd. ix. note
1 .

99. Mamercus Scaurus, οἵ similar
character (3. 66, 3), was cos. suff. possibly
in 774, A-D. 21 (Borghesi). On his ac-
complishments and fate see 6. 29, 43
where his death, twenty years aster this
date, is ascribed to the influence of
Macro.

10. quousque, etc. The whole sentence
might give offence from its tone of im-
patience, like the ‘ aut agat, aut desistat ³
of some other speaker (Suet. Tib. ²4)3
and ⁴ caput reipublicae ’ is an expression
more suited to the senate (cp. H. 1. 84, 92
6), than, at this early date, to the .
‘ princeps! The words of Scaurus would 'i
