56 INTR ODUCTION.

(2) Between two coordinated substantives; e. g. inter 4. 50, 2 ;
59, 2; 69, 2, etc. This and the above usage do not extend to mono-
syllabic preps. Ι

(3) With substantive preceding and attribute following;
e.g. ab 3.1o, 43 in 11. 3, 23 12. 56, 1, etc.; intra 11. 36, 4.

(4) Between a substantive and dependent genitive3 e. g.
ab 4. 5, 43 ad 3. 72, 2, etc.; apud 6. 31, 43 inter 4. 16, 6, etc.

(5) Between two substantives in appositi0n3 e.g. ab 2. 60,1,
etc.; apud 4. 43, 6; in 15. 53, 3.

(6) After two coordinated substantives3 e.g. inter 1. 60, 53
coram 4. 8, 7, etc.; simul 4. 55, 3. Of these, all except (2) are confined
to the Annals, and few instances occur in earlier prose. Dr. ξ 225,
Wfflfflin, Philol. 25, 115, Nipp. on 1. 60; 2. 60; 3. 1 3 103 72.

78. Anasta-ephe of conjunctione is also very common; among the
stronger instances is the position of si as fourth word 14. 3, 3; ut as
fifth 12. 49, 33 quasi as seventh 14. 52, 13 cum as tenth 1. 63, 6. But
such instances, as well as those of anastrophe of adverbs, as adeo
13. 25, 1, etc„ are not without classica] precedent. Dr. ξ 227, 228.

79. 'l'he occurrence of hexameter lines, or parts of such in'
Tacitus requires notice chiefly because it has been noticed (Botticher,
Proleg. p. xcvi.‚ Ruperti Ind. iii, Dr. ξ 255, Nipp. on 1. 1). Most
of the instanees are trivial (see the so-called hexameters in 3. 44, 43
15. 9, 13 73, 4; G. 18, 53 32, 1; Agr. 10, 4); one only is noteworthy
for its rhythm (auguriis patrum et prisca formidine sacrum G. 39, 2), and
one other for its position, as forming a complete period, and as the
opening sentence of the Annals. The hexameter with which Livy begins
is, as far as it goes, much more rhythmical, and he has many more such
verses or parts of verses than Tacitus. No more can be proved, than
that the ear of neither of these historians was so sensitive in avoidance of
such cadenceS, as that of Cicero (see de Orat. 3⁴47, 182 3 Orat. 56, 189)
or Quintilian (see 9. 4, 72).

III. Influence of tlte Study of Brevizfy.

80. Efflpses, and similar abbreviated expressions. By far the
, most important 'of these are found in syntactical usages already noticed, ·
in a large proportion of which the desire of brevity of expression appears
prominent ; especially in the omission of verbs (ἕξ 38, 39) 3 of prepositions
(see references on§ 56), and other particles (ἕξ 64, 65) ; in the fondness for
concise constructions with the infinitive (ἕξ 42, 43, 44, 46) 3 with gei-und
