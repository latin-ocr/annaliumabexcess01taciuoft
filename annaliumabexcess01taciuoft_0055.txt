1 (b) Gemdive. It is characteristic of Tacitus to employ this usage
; with wernsing, and latterly with great srequency: only three instances ,
being round in the minor works, and thirteen in the Histories‚ while it
abounds in the Annals. It is used with more than twenty adjectives (see
; ι. 23, 5; 37, ι ; 2. 57, 3, etc.)‚ and much ostener with verbs; osten so
as to be fully equivalent* to a final clause: ας. with deligere 2. 4, ι, etc.;

ἰ u simple dative is used with transitive or often with intransitive verbs,
with the force effa final clause ,· as morti deposcit ι. 23, 6; incessit itineri
” et praelio ι. 5ι, 4; factum est senatus-consultum ultioni iuxta et securi-
1³ tati ¹3· 32, ι. For other instances, see Dr. ξ 52, Nipp. on 1. 5¹·

„ ιι οι· ooonnionu, or medicativa dative (Roby 1 158), most frequent in
‘j the case os forms in ⁴-ui,' and especially used with the verb esse, is
g common in Tacitus. Roby bas collected (Pref. xxv-lvi) a list of about
ξ· 180 words so used by writers not later than Suetonius, os which thirty·
eight· are used by Tacitus, about five by him alone. 1t is still more
3 characteristic, that out ol only eleven instances collected os the use of such
3* ι dat. in apposition, eight are l'rom Tacitus, who thus uses usui and
{mutui twice (Ann. ιι. ι4, 5; Η. 3. ao, 63 Ann. ι2. ι4, 6, Η. ι. 78, ι),
