114 INTRODUCTION.

immediately after this marriage he was sent to suppress a· rising in
Dalmatia and Pannonia¹; and, after the death in 745, n-c. 9, of his
brother Drusus, at the head of whose funeral train he marched on foot in
mid-winter from the Rhine to Rome ², he prosecuted the war in Germany ’ς
for successes in which he was rewarded in 745 and 747, nc. 9, 7, by
triumphal distinctions of some kind⁴ and a second consulship in the
latter year. In 748, 13.c. 6, he seemed still more fully to fill the
place of Agrippa, by receiving for five years the tribunitian power; a
position which Augustus felt he could safely trust to one os such an
‘ unambitious temperament ⁵.’

It was now that he formed his strange resolution of retirement to
Rhodes, and with great difficulty obtained the necessary permission ⁸.
The conduct of his wife is assigned as the most potent reason ⁷ ; an in-
fluential second motive can be traced in the rise to manhood of the
young Caesars: and his retirement of seven years is character-ised by
studious‚ not to say pedantic pursuits ⁸, and initiation by Thrasyllus into
the dangerous mysteries of astrology, which took so firm a hold upon his
mind ⁹. After the banishment of Julia in 752, nc. 2, he had desired‚ but
had not been permitted, to return. The protection of his tribunitiam
power expired, and the rest of his absence was a scarcely disguised '
exile ¹⁰5 in which he was made to feel once sor all that a private position
to one in such a rank was impossible, by being exposed to insult and ]
even to peril of life, during the progress of Gaius Caesar to the East
under the sinister influence of M. Lollius ¹¹. In 755, ΛΑ). 2, the year of ξ
the death of Lucius Caesar, he obtained leave to return to Rome ς but
lived m complete retirement till the death of Gaius 1n 757, tun. 4, caused {T
a complete change' in his position. ¹

Now, at the age of forty- six, he was adopted into the family of the l
Caesars ¹² ‚his tribunitian power was renewed for another five yearsu, and ’
he was displayed as the heir before the greatest armies of the state ¹⁴. If
we are to believe Velleius, he was welcomed by the legions with raptures Ι
of enthusiasm, and his achievements in the next seven years place him
in the sront rank of Roman generals ¹⁶. The aim of these military
