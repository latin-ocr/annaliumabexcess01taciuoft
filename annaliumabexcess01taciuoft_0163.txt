‘comunione' withthe titlea of pontifex and quaestor (Hermen, Insc.
5396), 10 which oflices he was elected in 784 and 786, ΑΛ), 31 and 33
(Dio, 58. 8, 13 23, 1). As princeps he retains the name of Germanicus,
after that of Augustus (Insc. Orell. 702). After his first marriage with Junia

Claudilla, daughter os M. Silanus (6. ao, 13 Suet. Cal. 12), he had as
wives Livia Orestilla and Lollia Paulina, before Caesonia (Suet. Cal. 2 5).

The assassination of Gaius was followed immediately by that of Caesonia
and her child (Suet. Cal. 59).

14. A (16). Agrippina was born at ‘Oppidum Ubiorum' (12. 27, 1),
aud her birthday is preserved in an Arval Table. The year is fixed by
Mommsen (see note 8) from other dates. On her marriage to Cn. Domitius

Agrippina, Germanici Caesaris filia' Orell. 671, 67 3); but aster 803, Α.11.
50 (sce 12. 26, 2), she is styled on coins and inscriptions ‘Agrippina
angam· or ‘ Iulia Augusta Agrippina! nemen, Insc. 5387.

16. A (17). The dates of birth of Agrippina and Julia seem to show
the statement of Suet. (Cal. 7), that the three sisters were born in three
successive years, to be only approximately true. Drusilla must have been
born before the triumph (2. 4 1, 2), and probably in Germany. Her marriage
to Ι.. Cassius took place in 786, mn. 33 (6. 15, 4). She was afterwards
married to M. Lepidus (Dio, 59. 11, 1. See A, note 12). 111 inscrip-
tions during her life she is styled ‘Iulia Drusilla Germanici f.' (Insc.
Orell. 671), 11111 afterwards ‘Diva Drusilla' (Orell. ⁶7⁴3 Henzen 5389),
in consequence of the divine honours decreed by order of Gaius at her
death in 791, an. 38. Suet. Cal. 24; Dio, 59. 11.

18. Α (18). Julia is so called by Tacitus, by Dio, and on a coin

, (8011101, vi. p. 231) 3 11111 this name is borne by all the three sisters (see

notes 14, 15); and Suetonius distinguishes her from thern as Livilla (Cal. 7).
Ench name is supported by inscriptions, as ‘ Iuliae Germanici Caesar. filine,
and ‘Livilla Gemanici f.' (Insc. Orell. 676, 677). Tacitus gives the
date of her birth and the place (Lesbos) 2. 54, 1 ; and the date of her
, marriage to L. Vinicius (786, mn. 33), 6. 15, 1. She shared the banish·

³ ment and recall of Agrippina (note 13), 11111 was soon after again banished

 

' and putto death at the instigation of Messalina, Dio, 60. 8, 5. Sue-

tonius (Cal. 7) mentions the death in childhood of three other children of

4³ Germanicus and Agrippina, born apparently in the years 761-764, Α. 11.
