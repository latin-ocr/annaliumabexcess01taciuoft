Within this tract, the district afterwards known as· the ‘ agri decumates '
was no doubt at this time a debateable ground ¹3 but some such line as
that of the ‘limes' must have been already the frontier of Vindelicia,
until the point at which the Danube, by far the greatest river-frontier of
the Empire, forms, during the whole of its remaining course, the boundary
of Vindelicia or Rhaetia, of Noricum ², of Pannonia, and of Moesia.

In Asia Minor the frontier would mainly coincide with the Halys ³ and
Mount Taurus, till the incorporation of Cappadocia and Commagene
with the provincial empire in 771, Α. D. 18 ⁴, made the Euphrates a con-
tinuous frontier of these and of the province of Syria from a little above
lat. 39⁰ to about 36⁰.

From this point, neither east nor south has any such clearly marked
natural frontiers. We know that neither Palmyra ⁵ nor Petra ⁶ was within
the limits of Syria or Palestine3 that Egypt ended at Elephantine and
Syene⁷; while the other provinces on the African continent must have
occupied generally the strip possessed in earlier times by Greek,
Phoenician, and Libyan, as distinct from the abode of the Aethiopian
raees⁸. This portion of the empire was completed to the straits of
Gibraltar‚ by the addition of Mauretania in the time of Claudius ⁹.

Besides the many acts of Augustus, in respect of the acquisition‚
extension, consolidation, and regulation of provinces; by far the most
important change dating from his time is the division os the provincial
empire between himself and the senate 1⁰. Out of the distinct govern-
ments, about thirty in number ¹¹, subsisting at his death, only the following,
and these not at all times, remain in the hands of the senate: 1. Sicily3
2. Sardinia and Corsica ¹²5 3. Hispania Baetica 3 4. Gallia Narbonensis ;

5. Macedonia3 6. Achaia 13; 7. Asia ; 8. Bithynia (with part of Western
’ Pontus); 9. Cyprus; 10. Crete and Cyrenaica ¹⁴ ; 11. Africa (with New
Africa or Numidia). It has been mentioned above ¹⁶ that the governors
