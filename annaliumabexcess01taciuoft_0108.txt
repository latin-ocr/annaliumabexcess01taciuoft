90 INTRODUCTION.

class are found a generation later ¹. Even at this date, there are those whose
wealth and position might vie with that of the nobles ², and great numbers
must have belonged to professions or callings requiring high education
and earning high payment. The remainder probably swelled the ranks
of the client-class. Augustus endeavoured both to limit manumission by
enaetment and precept ³, and also to utilise freedmen in the service of the
state ; in which they formed the bulk of the ‘vigiles ⁴‚’ and were even
drafted wholesale into the legions after the catastrophe of Varus ⁶; while
under Tiberius a large number were deported to be made useful or left
to perish in Sardinia ⁶, and a law was passed to define the status of a
class of this order ⁷.

Any numerical estimate of the ‘ plebs urbana' with their wives and
families rests almost wholly on guess-work. We cannot tell how many
of the suburban or even nearest rural population may have helped to
swell the numbers of the 200‚ooo recipients of public corn under Augustus⁸,
or the 250‚000 to 300,000 sharers in his occasional ‘ congiaria ⁹.’ It is
therefore not surprising that calculations from such data give a result
varying from more than a million to less than half that sum ¹⁰.

Similar uncertainty attends the attempt to estimate the mass of public
and private urban slaves. They are generally called a vast multitude ¹¹;
the ‘familia ’ of Pedanius Secundus alone numbers 400 ¹²3 still the
maJ‘ority of the plebs must have had none or next to none, and many poor
knights or senators very few, A reasonable estimate takes them at
800,ooo or 900,000‚ who, with perhaps 60‚000 peregrini, and a garrison
of 20‚0oo ¹⁸, may make up the million and a half to two millions of souls
in Rome ¹⁴.

To this vast crowd the chief gift of Augustus was a fairly efficient
organization of police. The city was partitioned into fourteen ‘ regiones:
each allotted to the charge of one of the magistrates for the year ¹⁵.
