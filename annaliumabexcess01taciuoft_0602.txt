[A. U. C. 788.

 

1. sanguinis eiusdem, a grandson of 3, 1 ; 12. 4, 1 ;

the elder Phraates (e. 37, 6), probably
one of the four sent by him to Rome:
see on 2. 1, 2.

2. Hiberum: see on 4. 5, 4.

3. gentile, of his own nation: so ‘gen-
tile deeus’ 11. 16, 3: cp. 3. 59, 33 12.14,
2; 17, 33 342 4·

4. L. Vitellium: see on c. 28, 1. As
Syria had been vacated in 786, A. D. 33
(c. 27, 3), it is probable that Vitellius
mfatyilhpve been seutdout earlier {Is legate
o a rovmce, an ma now ave re-
ceived sldme extension ofy power similar
to that of Germanicus (2. 43, 2). A fuller
account of his actions in Syria and Pales-
tine, including his recall of Pilate just
before the death of Tiberius, is given in
Joseph. Ant. 183 c. 4, 5. See also Prof.
Rawlinson, p. 228, sqq.

6. in regendis, ‘in' is inserted by
Halm and Orelli, aster Otto: see on 3.
19, 2, where Halm also inserts ⁴ in.' Nipp.
here defends the MS. text by many in-
stances from Tacitus and other authors,
which seem hardly parallel, as the im-
mediate proximity here of another abl.
makes it the less probable that this one
stood without a preposition.

7. regressus, etc. He was recalled by
Gaius in 793, Α. D. 40, to answer a charge,
and escaped by abject servility (Dio. 59.
27, 4). On his conduct towards Claudius,
Messalina, and Agrippina, see 11. 2, 45

42, 4, etc.: other anec-
dotes of his servility are related in Suet.
Vit. 2. Dio (1.1.) follows Tacitus here
in recording both sides of his character.

8. adulatorii: the adj. is apparently
ἄπ. εἶρ.; the adv. found in August. Ep.
1 8.

411. perpulit. The inf. with this verb
appears to be found only m Tacitus (11.
292312 50‚;3 13 54‚3;H-·5 ²3)=
cp. Introd. v. ξ 42.

12. ministros, those who waited on
him: cp.3. 14, 3.

13. ad scelus, ‘to poisonhimz’ cp. 1.
5,1‚etc. This was the‘ dolus? the in-
vasion of Armenia the‘ vis' mentioned
above.

14. Artaxata: see 2. 56, 3.

15. Parthorum. The MS.has ‘partho-

rumque, ' whence it has been thought that ,

a word has dropped out, such as ‘Ario-
rum' (cp. 11. 10, 3), conjectured by
Bezzenb„ or ‘Medorum’ (c. 34, 6. where,
however, it seems to be another name
for the Parthians), by Her'aus. Beroald.
and other old editors read by transposi-
tion ‘datque.‘
16. auxilia. . . . facerent, notusedlike
‘stipendia facere,' but as equivalent to
‘auxiliares compararent:' so ‘exercitum
facere' (Vell. 2. 109, 1), ‘manum facere'
(Cic. Caec. 12, 33), etc.

17. Albanos: see 2. 68, 1.
