2 INTRODUCTION.

On the other hand, Pliny, who must have been born in 814 or 815,
ΛΑ). 61 or 62², speaks of Tacitus and himself as ‘aetate propemodum
aequales ς’ adding, however, that the oratorical reputation of his friend
- was already established when his own professional career began¹. It
appears to follow, that the birth of Tacitus, while it cannot be placed
later than 807, A.D. 54, can hardly have taken place earlier than 805,
A.D. 52. In other words, he must have been born in one of the last
years of Claudius, or in the first of Nero.
His parentage and family are unknown. We can assume the nobility
of no ‘Cornelius,’ as such, since the extension of that name to the
10‚000 freedmen of Sulla³; and the cognomen is one of those which
appear to indicate a servile origin ⁴. Even if this be so, most of the
equestrian, and many even of the senatorial, families in this age could
claim no higher origin ⁵ ; and although the Cornelii Taciti are unknown
in the Fasti, one of them at least had reached the ‘ equestris nobilitas'
of a procuratorship in the time of the elder Pliny⁶; and, as the name
is rare, may probably have been related to the histor-ian. It is again
to be inferred that he belonged to a family of some consideration, from
hisadmission to the quaestorship and senate, at the earliest, or almost
the earliest, legal age.
His praenomen is uncertain. Throughout the letters of Pliny, in
the allusions of Tertullian, Vopiscus, Jerome, and Orosius, and in the
second Medicean MS„ he has no fuller name than ‘Cornelius Tacitus!
On the other hand, the praenomen ‘ Gaius' is given to him by Sidonius
Apollinaris, a scholar of the middle of the fifth century ⁷, and that of
fPublius’ in the first Medicean MS.
Assuming the genuineness of the Dialogue ‘ de Oratoribus: we may
suppose him to describe in it the studies of his boyhood‚ and their
defectsss, corrected in his own case by an ardent study of the great ·
Classical models of Roman eloquence‚ particularly Cicero. He lays <
the scene of this Dialogue in 827, Aa). 74⁹, when he would be ξ
from twenty to twenty—two years of age; and represents himself in iv}
