132 INTRODUCTION.

neglect and disorder3 ambassadors and suitors ‚were unable. to get
a hearing¹; even the ‘album iudicum' is no longer filled up²; the
best men hang back from public service³ or are kept for years from
going to the province nominally entrusted to them⁴; others are left
year after year at their posts with apparent indifference to their merit-⁰23
whether they were judicious‚ as Poppaeus Sabinus ⁵, cruel and oppressive,
as Pontius Pilate⁶‚ or contumacious and dangerous, as Gaetulicus '¹.
Even the senatorial provinces, as Asia and Africa, seem to feel the
effects of the general irregularity Β; and even the security of the frontier
is said to be no longer fully maintained ⁹.

Some apparent taint of insanity seems to come in, completing and
partly explaining the whole: perhaps traceable sometimes in the clear
evidence of public documents 3 as in the attempt, in his published auto-
biography, to explain the condemnation of Seianus by a falsehood of
childish transparency 10; or in the famous words preserved of his letter to
the senate, publishing to the world his agony of soul ¹¹. Again, at one
time-reproach seems to lacerate him ¹², at another he parades it¹³; he hovers
round and round Rome and never enters it 1’; shifts his place restlessly
in the last stage of decrepitude ¹⁵. It is of little moment to decide be-
tween var10us reports of his end, or to know exactly how the last few
sands ran out of a life that to any good purpose had been extinet for
years.

As a set off against the judgment of Tacitus has been often sought in

the contemporary panegyric of Tiberius by Velleius ¹⁶, a few remarks τ

upon it appear here necessary. This writer’s means of information are Ῐ
indeed unquestionable ¹⁷ ; but his burst of courtly rhetoric, over even the

slightest service of his hero, takes away credit from his record of more ἶ
substantial achievements, even when described by him as an eye—witness. .
