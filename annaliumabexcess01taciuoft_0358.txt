cauSam veniret.

Several instances are here collected by
Nipp., in most of which there are special
reasons making the singular ‘nemo ' less
appropriate.

2. epistulis, used of a single letter, as
in 1. 30, 4, etc.

3. luxus et superbiae. The evidence
alleged sor the former charge is to be
inserted from c. 57, 5. The latter may
be supposed to have consisted in contemp-
tuous treatment of Piso himself.

seque pulsum, sc. ⁴ dicit‚’ latent in
⁶ incusat? This part of the charge seems
levelled, not at Germanicus. but at Sentius,
whose appointment he treats as the un-
constitutional act of a knot of private
conspirators. Hence the allusion to ‘ res
novae‚' to shift a charge made against
himself (cp. 3. 13, 3).

5. litorum oram. Either word might
have sufficed alone, but the combination
may have been suggested by ‘litoris
oram ' (Verg. G. 2. 44).

6. lato mari. ‘ Alto ' has been adopted,
from Lips., by several edd. (including
N ipp.), but ‘lato ' may be explained by its
connexion with ‘praeter insulas.' Several
islands lay in his course from Cos to
Rhodes3 and he was to pass outside
these, probably also south of Rhodes and
Cyprus, or at least not to take the usual
course along the coast of Lycia and
Pamphylia. He would thus avoid the
chance of collision with Agrippina (cp. c.
79, 1)'‚ and reach Syria before his move-
ments were known.

ille eludens respondit adfuturum, ubi praetor, 2

desertores, i. e. from the Syrian le-
glcglsyexillum. On the use of this and ’
its cognate words os any kind of legionary
detached force, see on 1. 38, 1, etc.
These are a body of recruits to be drafted
into the Syrian legions.
9. Cilicum, i.e. those of Trachoe. (see
6. 41, 1),and Olbe (Marquardt‚ Staatsv. i. γ
p. 227). A third principality had lately
come to an end (cp. c. 42, 7). His action ’
here and in c. 80 shows that Cilicia be- γ
longed at this time to Syria. See Mar- ,
quardt, Staatsv. i. p. 229. ζ
12. praelegentes, ‘coastingalong;’ a *i
Tacitean sense of the word: cp. 6. 1, 1. ῥ’
and similar uses of ⁸ prae ’ in composition ἐ
noted on c. 6, 5. ·.
15. Marsusque Vibius: cp. c. 74, 1. -
The latter name appears to be, intended
in the MS. ‘uibimus,' but is bracketed by
Ritt. Tacitus usually repeats one name ῗ
only of a person recently mentioned. but
Nipp. shows several exceptions to·this
mle, such as the repetitions ‘Junio Otho·
ni' 3. 66, 4; ‘C. Silani' 3. 69, 13 ‘Lar- 2
gus Caecina’ 11. 34, 2, etc. , “
nuntiavit. The proper word would v
be ‘denuntiavit;’ but ‘ nuntiare’ has in ,
Tacitus the meaning of ‘to command by j
message,' as in c. 65, 1; 11. 37, 2.
16. eludens, ‘turning it into jest:' cp. ⁴
5. 5, 1 ; 6. 46, 9, etc. The sense of the 2
word found in 3. 67, 2, etc„ seems less
suitable here.
