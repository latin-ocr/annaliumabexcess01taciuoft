¹ praepositam‚’ which would rather describe
such an arrangement as that at the funeral
of Augustus (Dio, 56. 34, 1), where the
position of a waxen effigy on the couch
has to be eontrasted with that of the real
body below; whereas in such a case as
this no real body could have been present,

toro. Unless ‘ praepositam' be read,
this must be taken as a free use of the
abl. os plaee; as also ‘externis terris’
above : see Introd. v. §r 25.

4. 57, 1 3 70, 6, etc„ and in several places
in Cic.

1. earmina, verses to be sung by> a
choir. Such a poem was composed by
Clutorius Priscus, but probably not till
afterwards (c. 49, 1).

et lacrimas. Nipp. notes that these
are not, like the former words, in apposi-
tion to ‘veterum instituta,’ but refer to
the conduct of Tiberius and others.

vel, ¹ or even.’

imitamenta: cp„ 13. 4, 1; 14. 57, 5.
The word is not found before Tacitus, and
very rarely later. ‘

3. Gnarum: cp. 1. 5, 4, etc.

utque premeret, ‘to repress? The
sense is mostly poetieal, and ostener used
of sels-control (e. g. c. 11, 2; 6. 50, 5).

4. ob rem publicam obisse, referring
to the inscriptions mentioned in 2. 83, 3.

6. egregium, ‘honourableffl cp. ‘mihi
egregiam erat’ (H. 1. 15, 1), and the subst.
c. 70, 4 ς 6. 24, 3, etc.: apparently a

Taeitean sense of the word.

adiceretur. Drager notes that this
verb is nowhere else used in this phrase ’
sor ‘adhibere'

7. principibus viris. Nipp. notes
that while this is thrown in to explain his
own apparent apathy, the addition of
‘imperatori populo’ removes the appa·
rent sels-exaltation by raising the nation
to his level. On the adjectival ‘impe-
rator‚’ cp. Introd. ν. § 3: also ‘ liberator
populus' (Liv. 35. 17, 8).

8. ex maerore solacia. On the con-
struction, see note on 1. 29, 3. The
sentiment resembles that of Ovid (Trist.
ἓ. 13, =238) ‘expletur lacrimis egeriturque

o or.

10. divus Iulius . . . divus Augustus.
Their firmness on these occasions is
dwelt on by Seneca (Cons. ad Marc. 14,
33 15, 2): also Suetonius says of the
latter (Aug. 65), ‘aliquanto patientius

mortem quam dedecora snorum tulit? “
