1. Germanicae legiones. The pro-

vinces of ‘Germania Superior' and ‘In-

been related to him.

serior' consisted chiefly of German tribes
transplanted to the left bank of of the
Rhine. On their northern and eastern
frontier, see Introd. vii. p. 93. Though
not always distinguished from Gallia
Belgica, they were certainly at this date
separately governed‚ and parted from it
by the line drawn between Germans and
Ganls, which in Upper Germany coin-
cided mostly with the Vosges, in Lower
Germany partly with the lower course of
the Scheldt (Pl. N. H. 4. 14, 28, 98). The
two provinces were parted from each
other by the Nabe (Nava), or perhaps
the Mosel; and the two headquarters of
govemment were at Koln and Mainz, the
latter of which is erroneously assigned to
Lower Germany by Ptolemy, whose ae-
count (2. 10) appears to be inaccurate in
other respects (see Dict. of Geog. s.v
‘Obringas’). For further account. see
Marquardt, Staatsv. i. p. 120, soll.. and,
on the legions. Introd. vii. p. 103.

4. tii-acturis. On this concise use of
the future participle, see Introd. v. ξ 54 ἀι
The MS. text ¹ tracturus ’ has been gene-
rally thus corrected; ‘sua,' here, as at
the yend of this chapter, being more pro-
perly referred to the legions; and ‘tra-
here’ being elsewhere used (e'p. ‘tractis’
below, and H. 2. 86, 4; 3. 44, ι) of

⁴ troops inducing others to follow their

lead.

5. Ο. Silio. He had been cos. in 776
A. D. 13; and received the ‘triumphalia'
later (c. 72, ι). On his subsequent
achievements. see 3. 42, 2, etc.; on his
trial and death, 4. 18; 19; on his son's
share in‘ the infamy of Messalina, 11. 12,

6. A. Caecina. As legatus ofLower
Germany he must have been of consular
rank; he also received‘ triumphalia’ (c.
72, Ι), was a veter-an soldier (c. 64 ι),
and had won distinction m Pannonia and

Moesia in 759, 76ος ΑΗΒ 6, 7(Vell. 2. .

112, 43 Dio o, 55, 29-32). He is subse-
quently mentioned with the cognomen
‘Severus'(3.18‚3; 33 1).

regimen summae rei. Silius and
Caecina were the‘ legati Augusti proprae-
tore’ in the two‘ Germaniae·’ Germani·
cus had‘ proconsulare· imperium ’(see on
c. 14, 4) over these and the Gaulish pro-⁸
vinces.

7. agendo Galliarum censui·
sum agere' is a common phrase (14. 46,
2; Liv. 3. 22, etc), as also· censum acci-
pere' (c. 33, 1), os those who received the
returns of property which the subj ects had

.ῐο furnish (‘ censum deserre.’ asj6. 41, ι,

etc). On such returns would rest the

(Suet. Jul. 25). The first systematic cen-
sus os Gaul appears to have been held by
Augustus in 727, 13.c. ²7 (Dio, 53. 22.5),
and revised by Drusus in 751, B.c. 13
(Liv.Epit.136; 137: ‘Oratio Claudii'sub
fin.;) and again revised now, and later
(2. 6, ῐς 14. 46. 2). See Marquardt,
Staatsv. ii. p. ²04·

12. Ubiorum. This tribe, whichinthe
time of Julius Caesar lived be) ond the
Rhine, but had been already assimilated
to Gallie civilisation (B. G. 4. 3, 3). was
transplanted‚ with its own consent, by
Agrippa (12. 27, 2; G. 28,5 ·St1ab. 4.
3, 4, p. 194), probably in 716 Β. c. 38
