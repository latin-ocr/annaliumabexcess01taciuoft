1. nihil in exercitibus. Not only the
auxiliary forces, but to a great extent the
legions, had come to be recruited from
the provinces (see Introd. vii. p. 108).
The ‘urbana plebes' had been drafted
into the ranks on emergency (cp. 1. 31.
4); but the old Italian reeruiting grounds
of the Republic now, ‘ vix seminario exi-
guo militum relicto ’ (Liv. 6. 1 2, 3), barely
served to keep up the praetorian and ur-
ban cohorts (4. 5, 5),

4. Andecavi ae ¹Pur-oni. These an-
swer to the provinces of Anjou, on the
right of the lower Loire‚ and Touraine,
on both sides of that river, above it. Their
capitals, Angers and Tours, are known
from the time of Ptolemy (2. 8, 8, 14) as
Juliomagus and Caesarodunum,

5. Acilius Aviola.. He was then lega-
tus of Gallia Lugdunensis; and was aster-
wards cos. suff. (Marquardt‚ i. p. 122). He
is thought by N ipp. not to be the consu-
lar of that name, mentioned by Val. Max.
(1. 8, 12) and Pl. mai. as a signal in-
stance os suspended animation; but the

father of the consul of 777. Α. D. 24 (4.

while he could not make up his mind how
to deal with it.

alam equitum. The ‘ala Treveb
rorum ’ is mentioned in 822, A. D. 69 (H.
2. 14, 2: 4. 55, 1), ‘ala equitumTreviro·
rum' in a Rhenish inscription (see Orelli
and Nipp.). The words here, ⁸ quae . . .
habebatur,' imply that it was, like so
many other ‘alae’ and ‘cohortes' meu-
tioned in inscriptions, no less a standing
force than the legions.

16. negotiatoribus: cp. 262, 4, etc.
These Roman capitalists in the provinces
are constantly mentioned by Cicero (see
Ernesti, clavis) and others. They would
usually be of the equestrian order, and are
