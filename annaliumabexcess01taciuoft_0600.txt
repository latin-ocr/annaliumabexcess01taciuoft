1.- magis . . . stare res suas, ‘that
his power stood more by prestige than by
its own weight:’ cp. ‘stat vi terra sua,
vi stando Vesta vocatur' Ov. Fast. 6,
299 ; ‘virtute quam pecunia res Romana
melius stetit’ H. 2. 69, 5.

3. G. Cestio M. Servilio. On the
former, here called by Dio (58. 25, 2)
Γαίος Γάλλος, see on 3. 36, 2; and c. 7,
3. The latter is the historiari M. Servi-
lius Nonianus (see Introd. iii. p. 1 2), whose
father was mentioned in 2. 48, 1 ; 3. 22, 4.

nobiles Parthi, i. e. ‘megistanes;‘
see on 2.2‚1,ete. This narrative of
Eastem events (c. 31—37; 41—44), treated
very briefly by Dio (58. 26), appears to
be given more fully by Tacitus as a relies
to the tale of trials and executions (see c.
38 1)-

4. Art-abano: see 2. 3, 1, etc. He

mum’ is thus used, e.g. 2. 43, 3. Ritter
would so read here; but Nipp. points out
that the MS. text receives some support
from‘ veterrimos populos’ (Liv. 5. 54, 5).

contumelia.. Nipp. considers this
to have consisted in the demand itself.
But it was probably also distinctly ex-
pressed in the letter, as described by
Suet. (Tib. 66), ‘ parricidia et medes et
ignaviam et luxuriam obicientis, monen-
tisque ut voluntaria morte maximo iustis-
simoque civium odio quam primum satis
faceret!

10. Vonone: see 2. 1—43 583 68.

12. primum cyro. Halm, with Baiter.
thinks this the right restoration of the
MS. ‘icyro3' Ritter reads ‘a Cyro’ (cp.

‘a Lucullo' 13. 34, 4); others take the
dot to signisy merely that the ‘i’ is to be
expunged. On such a dat. as ⁸ Cyro,’ cp.

had not only paid court to Germanicus
(2. 58, 1), but also shown respect at his
death· see 0112. 72, 3.

5. aequabilis, ‘without caprice: ' cp.
‘cunctis vitae officiis aequabilis’ H. 4. 5.
4, ‘aequabilius. .provinciae regentur'
15. 21, 5. seealso4„ πο, 4.

7. inermem, ‘without warlike energyz’
cp. the account of his policy 111 c. 32, 1.

8. Attaxia: see 2. 56, 3. His death
may probably have taken place in the
preceding year.

Arsacen. This is hardly a perso-
nal name, but no other is known. Orelli
notes a tetradrachm inscribed ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ
ΑΡΣΑΚΟΤ ΔῙΚΔΙΟΤ ΕΠΙΦΑΝΟΥΣ as ap-
parenuy belonging to his coinage.

9. veterrimum: elsewhere· vetustissi-

bat ' (cp. 3. 49, 2). He bragged of these
old boundaries, as if he would make good
his right to all included in them. Sup-
posing only the Asiatic dominions of these
kings to be meant, all Syria and Asia
Minor would be eomprehended. Dio
(1. 1. ) adds that he actually attaeked Cap·
padocia.

supplied, as ‘a·t¹ocia' in ‘atrox caelum,
perinde ingenia’ (Flor. 3. 2, 2). In the
example noted by Quint. (8. 3, 82) of the
