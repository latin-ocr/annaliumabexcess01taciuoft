68 INTRODUCTION.

ψ the office of ‘pontifex maximus ¹‚' always hencefort'h held by the‘ princeps

until a Christian emperor conferred it on the bishop of Rome ²3 and the
formal acceptance‚ on universal acclamati0n‚ of the title ‘ Pater Patriae’
in 752, B.c. 2 ³.

The following inscription gives his titles nearly at the close of his life :
‘ Imp. Caesar, Divi F. Augustus Pontif. Maxim. Cos. xiii. Imp. xx.
Tribunic. Potestat. xxxvii. P.P.⁴ '

The first succession to the principate must have been modified by the
fact that the successor was already possessed of ‘ proconsulare imperium,'
and had the tribunitian power ⁵, and afterwards numbered his years of this
office without recognising any change at the death of Augustus. He also
dropped the fiction of periodical renewal of imperium, though a decen-
nial festival was held ⁶. He must have at least received by decree the
title of ‘ Augustus‚' which, though he affected some reserve in its use ⁷,

appears on all his coins and inscriptions; but he never allowed himself
to be called ‘ pater patriae ⁸.' It is also noteworthy that neither Tiberius,

Gaius, nor Claudius, uses the ‘ praenomen imperatoris ⁹.' The titles borne
by Tiberius at the close os his life are seen from an inscription quoted
elsewhere ¹⁰.

Gaius appears, from the account of Dio, to have been the first to receive
all the powers of the principate by a single decree ¹¹ ς while Claudius was
the first to take the name of ‘ Caesar‚’ to which he had no family claim,

as a name of the princeps and his house.
„ It has been seen that the term ‘ princeps’ in itselfimplied no monarchy,

&sor even magistracy ; but in fact stood for a combination of magisterial

powers, so as to be contrasted as a kind of greater magistracy with the
office of consul, praetor, or aedile ¹². The boast of Augustus, that his emi· ²
nence in rank gave him no more power than his colleagues in any office ¹⁸,
can only apply, even in the letter, to such a case as that of his consul· ¹
ships, and has no meaning in relation to the most essential powers of
the principate‚ the ‘ proconsulare imperium ' and ‘tribunitia potestas: in
which he had, as a rule, no colleague. Nor were these powers confined

to their original limits, but received great successive extensions by steps .
