teius Agrippa et C. Vibius, certabantque cui ius perorandi in

Libo sine patrono introisset, singillatim se crimina obiecturum
professus, protulit libellos vaecordes adeo, ut consultaverit Libo,
an habiturus foret opes quis viam Appiam Brundisium usque

1. libellos et auctores, ‘the informa-
tions and names of the infor-mers)

2. moderans, ‘restraining himself ;’
so ‘moderante ’ 1. 15. 2 : usually a dative
is expressed‚ as c. 70, 4; 6. 2, 6, etc.

3. Fonteius ,agrippin mentioned
again c. 86, 1. Another, probably his
son, is mentioned H. 3. 46, 5.

4. G. Vibius, the elder Serenus: see
4.13,2; 28‚1,etc.

perorandi, ‘making the formal ora·
tion? The word often means no more
than this (cp. 3. 17, 7 and‘ perorare cau-
sam' in Cic, etc). Nipp. notes that the
plroperfptllzlzce og such oration was at the
c ose ο 2 evi enee.

6. singillatimst one by one; ’ so that
they might be argued separately without
a continuous oration on either side.
Cicero adop ted a somewhat similar
course, to expedite the trial of Verres:
Nero enforced this practice generally in
trials before himself: ‘cognoscendi mo-
rem eum tenuit, ut continuis actionibus
omissis, singillatim quaeque per vices
ageret' (Suet. Ner. 15).

7. libellos, papers belonging to Libo.

consultaverit = ‘consultavisse mou-
straretur?

10. uni . . . libello. ‘Nominibus’
must be taken as a dative depending on
‘additam ⁷ and it is not more difficult to
extend the same construction, than to
supply any other (such as ‘inesse ’from

‘inerant ') for‘ libello! Also the correc-
tion‘ uno '(Kritz and Nipp. ) still leaves
an awkwardness m the juxtaposition of
two different ablativae, ‘libello' and

‘manu’ It seems therefore necessary to
suppose some negligence in the original
composition.

1 1 . Caesarum aut senatorum, i.e.some
to the one set of names, others to the
1<ither- see on 1. 55, 2, and Nipp! s note

ere

atroces vel occultas notas, ‘dead-

ly, or at least mysterious symbols? Itis

. meant that, if no meaning could be made

out of them, the mystery was itself sus-
picious. We are to suppose that caba-
listic characters were attached to the
names, and that it was suggested that
these might be a magieal ‘devotio‘ (see
on c. 69, 5). It is implied by ‘amen'
that this document was the only relevant
evidence; so that the whole charge ap-
pears to have turned ou these unintelli-
gible marks.

12. adgnoscentes:
28, 1. N ipp. calls attention to this illus-
tration of the rule by which slaves were
forced to confirm, under tortum, even

13. vetere senatus consulto. This ’

11112, called ‘mos maiorum’
(pro Deiot. 1, 3), had even iu his time
exceptions in cases of incest and conspi-
racy (Mil 22, 593 Partt.Oratt.34‚ 118).

Lips. states that the later jurists also ῃ

make exception iu charges os· maiestas'
(without the fiction 11212 introduced),
adultery, and ‘fraudatio census!
