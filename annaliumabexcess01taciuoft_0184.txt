of his own hearsay (ἤδη ἥκουσα ὅτι κ.τ.λ.)

each individual.

inductam, ‘was put on:' like ‘per-
sonam induere? Thus ‘inducere plumas’

is different.

mory3’ so used of Tiberius, c. 69, 7.

said ⁴ reponere odium' Agr. 39, 3.

4. Niln‘l . . . passus. The omission of

his usual rule: the insertion (adopted by
Halm from Nipp.) leaves the absence of

supremis. This appears to mean
‘obsequies' in 4. 44, 6; but more com-
monly ‘death,’ as in 3. 49, 15 6. 50, 3;
12. 66, 2, etc.

5. per virgines Vestae. Wills, trea-
ties, and other documents, and sums of
money. were deposited sor sasety with the
Vestals (Suet. Jul. 835 Plut. Ant. 9423
Dio, 48. 37, 1), or in other temples (Juv.
8, 1435 14, 260, etc). This will is given,
with some variations and additions. by
Suet. (Aug. 101), and Dio, or Xiphil.
(56. 32), whose accounts should be com-
pared throughout with Tacitus. Suet.
states that it had been deposited with the

¹ Vestals sixteen months previously. Chari-
sius (1. 80, P; 104 Keil) quotes from it,
as still extant in the 4th century, ‘gausapes,
lodices purpureas et colorias meas.’

{hii-ds to Tiberius, one-third to Livia (Suet.
1. 1.)- Diopdds that a decree was passed to
exempt her from the disabilities of the

71.> Augustum. This is apparently the
right reading of the MS. (corrected to
‘ Augustae: probably from ‘ Augusta ’) ;
‘ adsumebatur ’ could hardly be used with
‘ Augustae,’ as no such name previously
existed. ‘Augustum’ is an adj„ as in
‘ mensis Augustus‚’ etc. Cp. ‘nomen
Sempronium ’ (c. 53, 8), ⁴ Furium’ (2. 52,
7), ‘ Africanum cognomen? (Liv. 30. 45,
65. She is always called Augusta by
Tacitus hencesorth. On the titles borne
by her, see Introd. ix. note 26, and on
subsequent ‘ Augustae‚’ Momms. Staatsr.
ii. p. 764. The title ’Augustus' was con-
serred by the senate on Tiberius with the
principate itself‚ but not generally used
by him. See Introd. ix. note 28.

7. in spem secundam, sc. ‘scripserat’
An elegance of expression sor ‘heredes
secundos‚’ ‘ heirs in default.' Suet. gives
the proportion as one-third to Drusus,
two-thirds to Germanicus and his three
sons. Agrippa Postumus and Julia are
disinherited.

8. primores civitatis, ‘ propinquos
amicosque complures’ (Suet.). This posi-
tion would be an empty compliment, and
is therefore set down to mere ostentation. .

legata. Dio states that many rela-
tives, also strangers‚ knights as well as
senators, even foreign khgs, were among
the legatees. Suet. adds that in the will
Augustus estimated the residue to the
heirs at not more than 150 million H. S. ;
and stated that he had himself received in
twenty years legaeies amounting to 1400
