1. Aegypto remeans. Quintilian (1.
5, 38) ranks Aegypto venio' among sole-

Orontes, described by Polybius (5. 5 , 3,
etc.), Strabo (14. 5, 20, 676), and o ers.

cisms; but it is admitted that in good
prose the Latinized Greek names of
countries' m‘ -us’ may be used, likenames
of towns», in the corresponding accusative
without a prep. (cp. c. 59, 1 ; and Madv.
233, Obs. 4) ; and the usage of Tacitus,
in respect of names of places to which and
from which motion takes place, is marked
by peculiar freedom: see Introd. v. § 24,
and many more instances cited here by
Nipp.

4. intentabantur: so Halm, after
Wurm, for the MS. ‘ temptabantur,' which
is retained by Orelli and Nipp. The cor-
rection is supported by many analogous
passages (e. g. 1. 27, 1; 3. 28, 6; 36, 1;

festam. The use of this ygord, other-
wise than with expressions of time, is
chiefly poetical: cp. 3. 9, 3; 14. 13, 2, etc.

Antiochensium Germanicus was
lying ill at its suburb Epidaphna (c. 83,
3). This great city and Alexandria were
,- at this time second only to Rome in
population, and probably exceeded it in
area. It has been noticed by Fried-
rander (Sitteng. ii. p. 124) that Antioch' rs
far less celebrated than Alexandria in the
literature of the first and second century
Ad).

8. Seleuciam, Seleucia Pieria, a well
known coast city near the mouth of the

1t was the usual port of embarkation from
Antioch: cp. Acts 13, 4.

degreditur, the MS. text, retained by
Nipp. and Halm. Most others have
followed Lips. in reading ‘digreditur.'
The two forms seem to be confused in both
Med. MSS„ and have often been altered
by editors (see Gerber and Greef‚ Lex..)
But ‘degredior’ seems to be naturally
used os a person (as here) going down to
the coast, or (asin 4. 74, 4; 6.1,2) land-
ing fr'om sea. It may also mean ‘to set
forth; ' and Nipp. so renders it here.

45, 22and <v-1-) 4· 7¹‚5· ,

10. persuasio veneni. Tacitus, as
elsewhere, does not affirm this charge of
poisoning (cp. c. 73, 5; 3. 14. 2); but
hkere islays only that the belief aggravated
t ei uess.

et reperiebantur-3 i. e. these were not
merely imagined‚ but actually found.

11. erutae. The simple abl. with this
verb appears elsewhere to be confined to

oets.
p humanorum corporum reliquiae.
Of the use of these in magic we have fre-
quent evidence (e. g. Hor. Epod. 17, 47 ς
Sat. 1. 8, 22; Lucan, 6, 533, etc.). On
the magic of the age, see notes on c. 27,
2 ; 3ο, 2.
