power was assumed ‘ aus icato,' but
Mommsen (Staatsr. ii. p. 7 7) considers
the expression here a figure of speech.
gentile solum, ‘his satherlandz· cp.
‘gentiles nationes ' (ε’ the people of his
birthplace') 11.1, 2, and note on 6.32, 5.

1. bellum seilicet: ‘esse ’ is to be sup-
plied, as in · parum subsidii ' 2. 4, 4, ‘ne-
que enim societatem ' H. 4. 14, 4. Prob-
ably here the construction is designedly
exclamatory.

diverso terrarum. On ‘diversus‚' cp.
1. 17, 5, etc. ς on the genit., Introd. v.
5 za.

32. cum maxime, ‘just now.' This
phrase is used in 4. 27, 2, and in several
places in the Histories‚ etc„ also in Cic.
(Off. 2. 7, 23, etc.); Liv. (40 3²- 1, ete),
and others. A fuller form is ‘ nune cum
maxime,’ and the phrase is a modification
of ‘ nunc ut cum maxime ’ (cp. Ter. Hec.
1. 2, 40), which means ‘now especially?
For a full discussion of it, see Hand,
Turs. iii. p 599. foll.

imbui. ‘ was being instrueted: ' cp.
12. 32, 5; H. 5. 5. 4. etc.

3. gravaretur, with accus„ as in 5. 8,
3: the usage appears first in Hor. (Od.
4. 11, 27). thence in Seu„ ete: ‘sane‚’
concessively‚ as in c. 5, 4, etc.

,μ fessam aetatem: cp. 1. 46, 3, etc.

7.. vim . . . sibi firmans. Ritter un-
derstands this of the association os Drusus
in the tn‘bunitian power, but it may
equally refer to the stability given to the
constitution by this show of power lest
to the senate. See Introd. vi. p. 773
Mommsen, Staatsr. ii. p: 916.

imaginem: cp. ‘imago reipublicae‘
13. 28, ι, etc.

8. postulata provinciarum, The old
function os the senate in this respect is
described by Polybius (6. 13, 7). That
here left to them concems their own pro-
vinces only; the deputations mentioned
in the three next chapters, and in 4. 14,
1—3, being from Asia, Cyprus and Crete:
see also 13. 4, 3.

10. asyla. statuendi. On the corre-
sponding practice at Rome. cp. c. 36, 1.

conplebantur, etc. Three classes
are mentioned as using these ‘asyla‚‘
(1) runaway slaves; (2) debtors 3 (3)
criminals.

1 1. subsidio, ‘place of refuge: ’ so c.
36, ις 4 67, 2; 5. 8, ¹.

12. receptabantur. Excepting in this
place and Liv. 5. 8, 2, this verb is used
only by po'ets.

13. validum, with gerundive dat, as in
c. 10, 4. The ‘ seditiones ' spoken of would
be those raised by any attempt to re-
strain the abuse of sanctuary.

14. flagitia . . . protegentis, ‘ protect-
ing human outrage no less than religious
observances.’ The antithesis is hardly

as pointed as it seems, for ‘ hominum‘ is ⁷

a subjective and ⁴ deum ' an objective
genitive. The pl. ‘caerimoniae ’ appears
to be sometimes equivalent to ‘res samael
as in the phrase ⁴ habere aliquid in caeri-
moniis' (Pl. N. H. 37. 7, 28, 100), andis
by some so explained in H. 1. 43, 2, ‘ in'

contubernio (aedis Vestae) abditus non .,

religione nec caerimoniis sed latebra im·

minens exitium differebat.' Such may
