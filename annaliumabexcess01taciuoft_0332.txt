the tribes dwelling in what was after-
wards called ‘ Mauretania Sitifensis,’ west
of the. Ampsagas‚ appear to be meant.
‘Mauri' and ‘ Maurusii ’ are general names
for the inhabitants of Mauretania, whose
modem representatives appear to be the
Berbers.

1. Romanum in modum armatos.
Th0se who are described above as or-
ganized ‘per vexilla et turmas,' i.e. like
similar forces under Roman standards.

2. disciplinae . . . suesceret. The
simple verb is nowhere else transitive,
though such use is implied in that of
⁸ suetus) The MS. has ‘ disciplina,' which
Ritt. and Nipp. retain; the latter noting
the use of such an abl. with ⁸ adsuefaci0‚’
and, occasionally‚ with ‘adsuesco.’ Ho-
race has (Sat. 1. 4, 105) ‘insuevit . . . hoc
me ; ’ which is apparently a double accus-
ative.

3. copia: so4. 4, 63 27, ²3 47, 1; 56,
1, etc. The singular, though sar more
rarely found in this sense than the plural,
is so used in Cic., Caes, and Sall.

4. Cinithios. This people, according
to Ptolemy (4. 3, 22), lived near the lesser
Syrtis: ὑπ’ αὐτὴν Κινίθιοι, καὶ ἀνατολικώ·
τεροι μέχρι τοῦ Κινῦφου ποταμοῦ N ιγὶτιμοι.
The Cinyps is nearly equi-distant from the
two Syrtes, and the Cinithii, though eon-
siderably westward of- that river, must
have lived far from the apparent seat of
this war.

5. Camillus. M. Furius P. s. P. n.
Camillus. cos. 761, Α. D. 8: cp. C. Ι. L. i.
p. 548. Nipp. notes that he was one of
the ‘Arvales‚ and probably died in 790,
A. D. 37. His son was consul in 785,
Λα). 3² (6. 1, 1).

pro consule. This, and ‘pro prae·
tore,' are the regular forms used in Tacitus
for ‘ proconsul ² and ‘propraetor ’ (e. g. c.
g6‚t1;)3- 3², 13 35, 1;38,1;66,2; 72.

, e c. .

6. legionem. The one legion (‘tertia
Augusta’)‚ usually stationed here: see
Introd. vii. p. 103.

quod sub signis, i.e. the standing
¹{zuiriliary force usually attached to the
egion.

conductos, ‘concentratedz' so ‘con-
duceret ’ 4. 47, 1. The gender is adapted
not only to ⁵ socios ’ but to the soldiers of
the legion: cp. 14. 20, 7.

7. Numidarum. The Musulamii as
distinct from the Mauri.

8. aeque quam. Tacitus often (e.g. c.
65, 13 4· 49, 2; 71. 43 14· 38³ 3, ete.)
adopts, from Plaut. and Liv„ this
construction with a negative. using once

ac?
ne bellum . . . eluderent3 i. e. if a

larger force was brought against them.

‘Metu’ is explained by 4. 24, 2, as their
sear both of the Roman name, and of the
attack of regular infantry. - ‚⁷

10. medio. On this abl. of place, see j
Introd. v. ξ 2 5. ’

13. filiumque eius. The great man's ³
son, L. Furius Camillus, though consul ψ

(405, B.c. 349) and twice dictator, and
not without the reputation of victorioe
(Liv. 7. 28), is of less note than the
grandson of the same name, who gained

a triumph in 416, B.c. 338, and was ,

again consul in 429, Β. c. 345 (Liv. 8. 135

29). Tacitus appears to consound these c

together.
