CORNELII TAf'ITI ANNALIUM [A. U. C. 769. 1

annos rem publicam exedere? Firmius Catus senator, ex· intima Β
Libonis amicitia, iuvenem inprovidum et facilem inanibus ad
Chaldaeorum promissa, magorum sacra, somniorum etiam in-
terpretes impulit, dum proavum Pompeium, amitam Scriboniam,

5 quae quondam Augusti coniunx fuerat, consobrinos Caesares,
plenam imaginibus domum ostentat, hortaturque ad luxum et
aes alienum, socius libidinum et necessitatum, quo pluribus in-

diciis inligaret.

1. Firmius Catus: see 4. 31, 7: ‘ex
intima amicitia' for the concrete ‘ ex in-
timis amicis‚’ as in c. 77, 1.

2. facilem inanibus, ‘easily led to
empty projects:' cp. 5. 11, 1; also ‘ sa-
ciles occupantibus' H. 2. 17, 1; and
similar uses in Verg. aud Liv.

3. Chaldaeorum. The astrologers,
known also as ‘mathematici‘ (c. 32, 5;
H. 1·. 22, 1 ; etc.) ‘ periti caelestium’ (4.
58, 2), and by other names; who pro-
sessed to predict a person's destiny from
the position of the heavens at his birth.
Though sufficiently important as early as
625, B.C. 139, to be expelled by a praetor's
edict (Val. Max. 1. 3, 3), their great
ascendancy belongs to this age; those
who dealt severely by some being them-
selves the patrous of others, as Augustus
(Suet. Aug. 94), Tiberius (6. 21, 5 ; Suet.
Tib. 14), and many following emperors.
The prevalence of astrology in the time
of Augustus is seen in the allusions in
Hor. Od. 1, 113 2. 17, etc.; its subse-
quent importance may be illustrated by
the sull collection of passages from
ancient authors given by Prof. Mayor on
Juv. 14, 248. See also Marquardt,
Staatsv. iii. p. 90-92. That Tacitus him-
self believed some astrological predictions
to be genuine, is seen from 4. 58, 2: 6.
22, 5, etc. ; his contempt for the common
herd of impostors is shown in H. 1. 22,
1, and elsewhere. ⁴

magorum saera, ‘the rites of ma—
gicians.' These ‘magi’ also *profess an
Oriental title, and are sometimes con·
founded with the ‘Chaldaei ς’ but the
name properly belongs to the dealers in
philtres and other drugs, spells, and in-
cantations (see c. 28, 3 ; 69, 5, eto). The
art in some form is so old in Italy as to
have fallen under the ban of the Laws of
the Twelve Tables (Sen. Q. Nat. 4. 7, 3);

and‘ venefica* is a tenn of abuse as early
as Plautus and Terence: the witehcrast of
the Augus <tan age may be illustrated from
Verg. Ecl. 8· , Hor. Od. 1. 27, 21· , Epod.
5: Sat. 1. 8; Ov. Am. 1. 8, etc. See
Marquardt‚ Staatsv. iii. p. 106-112.
somniorum interpretes. This art
belonged of old to the Eastem‘ magi’
proper (Hdt. 1. 107, etc.;) and its pro·
fessors, known in Italy as early as the
time of Ennius (Cic. de Div. 1. 58, 132),
are generally called‘coniectores'(P1aut.
Cure. 2.1, 345 Cic. de Div. 1. 22, 455
Quint. 3. 6, 3ο, etc..) See Marquardt,
Staatsv. iii. p. 993 and the full account of
the Roman belief· m dreams m F riedl. lii.

P ᾅδῃ-»φανῶ Pompeium. A full pedi·
gree is given by N xpp from Borghesi (5,
301), showing that his mother Pompeia
was daughter of Sex. Pompeius and of
Scribonia, niece os the wife of Augustus,
who was thus his great-great-aunt ; and
whose descendants through Julia were in
a wide sense his‘ consobrini' Also the
adoption of his father, M. Drusus Libo,
by M. Drusus Claudianus, the father of
Livia Augusta, connected him with her
issue.

6. plenam imaginibus. That the
‘ius imaginum’ was now liberally inter·
preted, would appear from 3. 5, ος 76, 4,
etc.

7. necessitatum, This word‚used in
a somewhat different sense in 1.11,6‚
appears here, as in Suet. Tib. 47, to de-
note any pecuniary obligations or diffi-
culties. It thus answers to‘ aes alienum:
as ‘libidinum' does to‘ luxum!

9. noscerent, for‘ adgnoscerent,' ‘would
acknowledge3 ’ cp. ‘adgnoscentes servos⁸
