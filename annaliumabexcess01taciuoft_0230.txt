1. a· contactu, ‘from contagion:‘ so
used properly in 4. 49, 4, and figuratively
often in Tacitus, as 6. 7, 4, etc.

dividite = ‘ secernite ι ’ cp. ‘ pro·
vinciae quae mari dividuntur’ (2. 43, 2);
‘ dividere defensionem ' (3. 15, 3). Earlier
prose writers appear always to add the
prep. and abl. of separation.

6. reditum Agrippinae excusavit.
Elsewhere, the accusative with this verb
either denotes that which has been done,
and is apologised for; or (as in 3. 11, 2,

etc.) that which is pleaded in excuse.

Here it means ‘excusavit Agrippinam,
quod non rediret.’ · r

inminentem. This belongs pro-
perly to ‘partum,‘ but may extend its
force somewhat to ‘hiemem.' An altar
at Ambitarvium, a Treveran village near
Coblenz‚ inscribed ‘ ob Agrippinae puer-
perium‚’ is recorded to have been seen by
Pl. mai. (Suet. Cal. 8). Mommsen shows
(Hermes, 13. pp. 256, foll.) that neither
of the children born in Germany (In-
trod. ix. note 14 3 15) can have been born
in this year; and that we must sup-
pose at this time the probable premature
birth of a child which never lived, and
which has no place in the list given by

9. legatum legionis. On these offi-
cers, see Introd. vii. p. 105. Caecina, the
‘legatus Augusti propraetore‚' who had
led these legions to winter· quarters, ap-
pears now to have gone to the other camp
at Vetera: see c. 48, 1.

poenas . . . exercuit.. This appears
to be taken from Vergil (Aen. 6, 543);

Ι Suetonius.

and its strangeness is here sostened by com-
bination with the regular phrase ‘iudicium
exercere.'

10. pro contione. This construction

is familiar in the phrase ⁴ laudare aliquem -

pro contione' (2. 22, 1; Sall.; Liv., etc.),
where it is generally explained to mean
‘ before the assembly.’ But here the
legions are the assembly. Also, there
appears to be some evidence that the
‘ tribunal‘ or ‘rostrum ’ may itself be
called ‘ contio.’ Even thus, if ⁴ pro cou-
tione ’ were equivalent to ‘pro tribunali '
or ‘ pro rostris: and analogous in Tacitus
to ‘ pro ripa,’ ‘pro munimentis: ⁸ pro
muris’ (2. 9, 3; 13, 4: 81, 133 it would
describe the position of the speaker
standing forth on the platsorm, rather
than the audience facing it. Unless
therefore we may take⁴ the phrase to
mean no more than that they ‘stood
forth assembled,' we must explain it (with
Nipp.) to signisy ‘ after the fashion of an
assembly3' the expression being probably
ehosen to imply that it was not strictly
a ‘ contio ' convened by the general, but
one sels-constituted. No such use of the
phrase has been however found elsewhere.
A rude trial of this kind. in which sol-
diets were allowed to butcher those whom
they pronounced guilty, is called ‘ priscus
mos’ in Ammian. 2. 9, 5.

1 1. suggestu. This is the regular term ,
for the ‘tribunal' or platsorm in camps,
as H. 1. 36, 1 ; 55, 53 Caes: Liv.‚ etc.
The construction dr such with piled up
turs is described in c. 18, 4, but it might
osten be a more permanent structure.
