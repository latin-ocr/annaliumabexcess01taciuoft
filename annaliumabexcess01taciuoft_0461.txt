³ specific thing with children, in the second place to heirs with children, in
the third to other legatees with children ¹, failing all these, to the aera-
rium ², or, in later times, to the fiscus. ι
This law, though having sor its apparent object ‘to add force to the
penalties on celibacy and to enrich the treasury ⁸‚’ encountered no such
’ vigemus opposition as that which had blamed the edge of the ‘lex
Iulia ¹.’ The senate had been schooled by twenty-five years of submission,
and people had perhaps found out that it was easier to evade laws than
. to resist their enactment. The consuls from whom this law is named
. were both unmarried⁸ ; nor, according to Tacitus ⁸, did marriage or the
rearing of children become more frequent.
Ῑ ln one respect the law was indeed most fruitsul. By it was given the
first general encouragement, on a large scale, and in a matter affecting
ἶ private lise, to systematic delation ⁷, and the first brood os professional
ἓ informers was called into being; whose activity in respect to other laws,
ς and especially that of ⁴ maiestas: forms so large a part of the domestic
ὲ history ot* the age. When this activity was let loose upon a law whose
Ῐ vast and complicated network was such as to entangle every family in
some or other of its meshes ⁸, we can easily see that its working must
, have mused intolerable annoyances unsoreseen at its enactment, and can
Α understand the outcry which in ten years was already demanding relaxa·
tion. ’Πιε law itsels thus marks the extreme limit of legislative interfer-
ence with private lise in this respect, and its subsequent history as known

vision was relaxed by Claudius ¹⁰, the rewarda of insormcrs were cut down

{ss not ¹⁹. Thus the severity of many os its penalties became so sar obsolete
