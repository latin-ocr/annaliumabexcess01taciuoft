18 INTRODUCTION.

nonian and German mutiny, and os the German wars, can be no mere
transcript of the report laid before the senate ².

But as regards all matters not forcing themselves by their magnitude
on public notice, much of the most interesting history must have been
buried for ever in the archives of the prince. To illustrate this we may
compare the information, scanty as it is, which we have in the Annals, of
the grievances, deputations‚ inner life of a senatorial province such as
Asia, with the absence of even any similar accounts of any Caesarian
province during this period. We should have known little enough, from
official, or indeed from any purely Roman sources, of the grievances
brought by Philo before Gaius, or of the oppressions which goaded
Judaea to desperation ².

Many again of the state trials which form so large a part of domestic
history were either before the emperor’s private court ³, or cases in which
the senate merely registers a sentence, passed on receipt of a letter or
notes of evidence from the prince or even his minister ⁴.

Means of information thus were scanty, but Tacitus notices a further
defect in his authors, from the faint interest taken even in what they
might have known. Men were ‘ ignorant of politics, as being no business
of theirs’ ⁵ but that of their rulers. Whoever has taken notice of the
‘indiligentia veri’ possible, even noxv, under circumstances of the utmost
publicity and fullest extension of public responsibility‚ even among poli-
ticians and political writers, on such public affairs as do not touch them
immediately, will appreciate the profound truth of this remark of Tacitus,
'at a time when neither such publicity nor responsibility existed.

Lastly, Tacitus divides all the chroniclers under the principate ⁰, or at
least all the successors of the great historians of Augustus ⁷, into two
sharply contrasted classes, the one, of those who wrote to flatter the
ruling prince, the other, of those who poured out their pent-up rancour
after his death.

We need not assume that each prince had his chroniclers of both these
classes. In the case of Tiberius especially, it has been already noticed ⁸,
that (except the few pages of Velleius already mentioned) no historiari
is known even by name to us, who published any account of the ἱ res
Tiberii,' ‘florente ipso? Without assuming that none existed where
none are known to us, we. may reasonably suppose that few, if any, cared
