16 INTRODUCTION.

the condemnation of Agrippina and her sons, and made solemn pro-
fession that he had never read them ¹. However this may be, other
journals of this prince are said elsewhere to have been preserved, and
to have formed the favourite study of Domitian ².

5. Public Inscriptions. It is needless to speak of the multitude which
must have been at the time in existence, or of their manifold value to
historians. Tiberius is stated to have taken great pains early in his
princip'ate to preserve and restore ancient documents³. We have, how-
ever, no evidence that Tacitus was in the habit of consulting inscrip-‘
tions, though he makes mention of decrees so recorded⁴, and once
refers to such evidence of the letters added to the alphabet by
Claudius ⁵.

6. Tradition. The lifetime of Tacitus was not so sar removed from
the days of even Tiberius, but that many traditional anecdotes were
still current. He states a report of this kind, for what it is worth, in
his account of the trial of Cn. Piso⁶; he mentions, in order to refute
it, an idle tale respecting the death of Drusus, son of Tiberius⁷3 and
frequently uses vague expressions, such as ‘ traditur‚’ ‘ ferunt,’ ‘memoriae
proditur,' and the like; which, though they sometimes evidently refer
to written narratives, may in others designate some such floating
stories.

It will thus be seen that as far as the mere amount of material is
concerned, the resources at the command of Tacitus were as ample as
are found at most periods of ancient history. How far Tacitus actually
used all that he might have used, is only occasionally indicated to ua,
but may to some extent also be inserted from a comparison of his
narrative with that of Suetonius and Dio ⁸.

Thereare perhaps no passages in Suetonius, and few in Dio ⁹, where
either of these authors appear to have followed Tacitus himself. Such
coincidences as would show that they had used informants whom he
has also followed, are of course very common ; but even in this respect
their difference is more striking than their resemblance. That os
Suetonius would be the natural result of his preference for biographical
