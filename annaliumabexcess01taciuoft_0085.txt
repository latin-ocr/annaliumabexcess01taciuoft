μ’ CONSTITUTION OF THE· EARLV PRINCIPA TE. 67

    

⁴ five years only, such censorial power as belonged to the ‘ regimen legum
et morum¹.’ It is also stated by Dio that he received at the same time
for life the consular power, with its insignia, the regular attendance of
twelve lictors, and a curule chair between those of the consuls of the year¹.
This is treated by Mommsen as an error, except so far as relates to the
mere assumption of the insignia ⁸. Augustus himself mentions two facts
only that bear upon the point. Firstly, that in 732, Β. c. 22, he refused
the dictatorship, and also both the annual and perpetual consulship ¹.
ξ Secondly, that twice in the latter part of his life he held a census with
‘consulare imperium ⁸,’ censorial power beingsimbo-theery—etzhe consti-
ζ- tutior), inherent in the consular, before the existence of the censorship as
a separate office. It is inferred, both from what he says and from what
ξ he appears to imply, that this ‘ consulare imperium' was used for this
Ξ purpose only, and that no general or permanent consular power was ever
ᾗ assumed “. It is obvious that a ruler holding a ‘ proconsulare imperium'
g vend within the pomoerium ⁷ had already what was most important in the
ξ consular power, and Augustus showed no desire for the accumulation of
ἔ empty tides. It would seem, however. possible that the decree which
¹ Dio appears to quote may have given something more than mere con·
³ aular insignia. The conception of the princeps as the chief magistrate
· of the state, implied in many powers exercised by Augustus and his
1 suecessors, might not impossibly have been represented by a consular
ἷζ power or certain specilied powers under that name; the more so, as such
⁹* power might be conceived by a fiction as comprehending functions of
ἢ other magistracies, as those of censor, praetor, or curule aedile, originally
included in the consulship. Some of these powers of the princeps are
f apecified below· ς to which may be added that of ⁸ nominating ⁹ candidates
με for magistraeiea ⁰, which appears in some sort to assume that the prinecps
Α π· imagined aa personally holding the comitia, which (in the case of
ᾗ electiona to the greater magistracies) would be a consular function ¹⁰.
ἶ During the remainder of this principate the chief points to notice are
ἱ the mccc-sive quinquennial or decennial renewals of the ‘ proconsulare J
’ ὶιιιρειίιιω“; ’ the assumption, on the death oi Lepidus in 7⁴2» a. c. ιι, of
