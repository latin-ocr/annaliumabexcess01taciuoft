120 INTRODUCTION. 1

-ει,

To say that he was austere and generally feared ¹, is to say that his ‘r‘
disposition was such as nature and circumstances had made it; noris
his carelessness of popularity unaccompanied with the rational desire of
solid approval. ²

The evidence on which the whole of this period is pronounced to be
one of mere sustained hypocrisy‚ is best challenged by taking the leading
instances alleged.

The first instance is at the outset‚ when a show is made of declining
the principate which every step had been taken to secure. Undoubtedly
the reluctance was so far insincere, that his Rhodian retirement must
have taught him, that for one so placed, the only safety was to rule 3 but
if we suppose his natural irresolution to have mingled with his disguise,
he would not be the only one whose sels-reliance had failed him at the
crisis of his fortunes: and of the reasons given for his conduct, two at
least are thoroughly substantial. As regards the armies, he certainly did
‘ hold a wolf by the ears ’ζ’ whether he was aware of the actual mutiny or ἐ·
not z· and the constitution of the principate, as well as the absence at this ἑ
date of any monarchical or dynastic tradition ⁴, required him to secure his
position by laying all stress on the apparent free choice of the senate ⁶.

Another leading instance is sought in his whole conduct to Germanicus,
which again, even in its most questionable points, shows habitual irresolu-
tion rather than malice. The position in which Germanicus is found at
the death of Augustus ⁶ is strengthened rather than impaired ⁷ ; he ,is
allowed to levy war in such mode and on such scale as he pleases3 his 1
distinctions are at least equal to his deserts 8; his recall, as has been said 3⁷
above ⁹, is justifiable. Yet it is but natural that the compulsory adoption ¹⁰ ¹
should rankle in a mind so disposed to brood on its grievances ¹¹: and, ¹
side by side with the confidence which Tiberius felt when great armies
were under his sons ¹², might lurk some distrust of the young man's popu· Ι
larity, and of the masculine energy of his wife ¹³. Thus we discern a ἒ
’ motive for sending him to the East‚ where the legions did not know him, ’“
and for replacing a legate so connected with him as Creticus Silanus ¹⁴ by ι
one who could be trusted at least to hold his own. Cn. Piso, again, was ’Μ
much to be mistrusted. The proudest member of one of the noblest
houses yet left1⁶, h‘e had spoken out in the senate¹⁶, and had perhaps been
noted by Augustus as dangerous ¹⁷. Yet his wife stood high in the favour 2
