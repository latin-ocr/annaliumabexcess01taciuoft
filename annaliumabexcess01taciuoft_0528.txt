in Sall. Jug. 100, 1 the soundness of the
text is not unquestioned3 in none of these
instances is the idea of the verb, as here,
the prominent thought of the whole pas-
sage; which is therefore more likely to
have run here as in 3. 31, 2.

1. apud capuam Iovi. This temple,
placed on a Capitol at Capua resembling
that of Rome, is called ‘ Capitolium’ in
Suet. Tib. 40.

apud Nolam Augusto, on the spot
where Augustus had died (cp. 1. 9, 1);
Dio says (56. 46, 3) ἡ ἐν τῇ Νὼλῃ οἶ-
κία, ἐν ᾗ μετήλλαξεν, ὲτεμενίσθη. In per-
sonally consecrating these, Tiberius prob-
ably acted as ‘pontifex maximus: see
note on 2. 49, 2.

certus, this use with the inf. is poet·
ical (Verg. Aen. 4, 564, etc.): see note
on c. 34, 2.

2. eausam . . mettun, ‘ Ι have referred
the cause:’ so in 6. 49, 2. The suggest-
ions of Seianus have been mentioned in c.
41, 2. On the reasoning of Tacitus, see
Introd. iv. p. 26; viii. p. 126. He ap-
pears here to overlook the probability
that the original retirement may have
been due to one cause, its continuance to
another.

4. coniunxit. The expression is prob-
ably equivalent to ‘sex annos continuos
mansit in secreto’ (Gerber and Greef¹ Lex.),
andakin to 6. 26, 3, rather than to c. 33,
3. l‘Secreto’ could be taken as abl. of

ua ity.
q plerumque permoveor, ‘I osten
hesitate! Drager notes a similar brachy-
logy in Cic. Clu. 37 ‘adducti suut iudices

 
    
   
 
  
 
    
 
    
     
   
 
    
  
  

(‘were induced to believe') non modo po·- ι
tuisse,’ etc.: cp. Att. 11. 16, 2. ⁷ His  

7. habitum: cp. on 1. 10,
personal appearance is described by Sue- ”
tonius (Tib. 68) without reference to any '
particular time of life. His bearing is
there recorded as stiff and erect; his
countenance as liable to ‘crebri et subiti ³
tumores,’ mentioned as a specific disease
by Galen (περὶ συνθέσεως φαρμ. 5, 12).
That his features were otherwise hand- ⁷
some and distinguished, is stated by Sue·
tonius, and evidenced by his coins and ⁷
other representations, especially the st· ’
mous sitting statue in the Vatioen (Mus. ’
Chiar. 400).
9. medicaminibus interetineta, ‘with ,
patches of plasterz’ cp. ‘candore inter-3
stincto . . . coloribus· Pl. N. H. 37. 10„

his sels-indulgence.¹ On the assumption
of fact here, see on 1. 4, 4.

son forv his retirement is also given · ¹j
Suet. (Tib. 51) and Dio (57. 12), in ι ·
of whom stories of their quarnels may ·ῗ
found. The memoirs of Agrippina ( jz
on c. 53, 3) were doubtless full of *ts-'2
material. ,
