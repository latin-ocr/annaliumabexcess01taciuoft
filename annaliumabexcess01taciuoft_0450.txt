1. humani divinique iuris sciens.
Nerva is similarly described in 6 26,1,
and, as juris prudence is defined to be

divinarum atque humanarum rerum no-
titia’ (Ulp.Dig.1. 1 10), a great jurist
would be versed ιιι both branches. Ma-
crobius (7. ι3, 1 1) especially credits Capito
with proficiency in pontifical, or divine,
law. See‘Marquardt, Staatsv. iii. p. 304,
n. 5.

egregium publicum. The analogy
of ‘ bonum,‘ ‘malum,’ ‘optimum’ ⁸ pessi-
mum publicum ‘ suggests that ‘egregium ’
is here to be taken as the substantive
(cp. 6. 24, 3; 14. 60, 1). In 4. 6, 2 ‘in-
lustres domi artes' are contrasted with
‘ claritudo militiae‚’ as comprising all ac-
complishments whose renown could be
gained at home, those of the jurist, orator,
or man of letters Iu this place the con-
trast seems rather to resemble that in 1.
13, 1‘ artibus egregiis et pari sama pub-
lice3' juristic learning being viewed as an
accomplishment of private life (⁴ domi '‚)
i. e. unconnected with any public office,
and thus contrasted with the ‘egregium
publicum’ of Capito, his distinction in
the state as a consular and leading sena-
tor. Or, if it be thought that these
words must be taken, on gthe analogy of

‘bonum publicumss etc.‚ to mean ‘the
honour of the state,' we still need not
refer the expression, with N xpp to the
glory of the imperial clemency, which
Capito could hardly be said dehones-
tare,' but may takey it of the renown
which so great a jurist had himself con-
fer-red, οιι his country.

3. religio, here ‘a religious difficulty’

or ‘ question:' ep, below, ‘de religioni-
bus.’

4. valetudine Augustae: cp. c. 64. 1.

6. nullum . . . erat. A difficulty arises
from the fact that a temple thus entitled
was dedicated at Rome in 581. B.c. ¹73
(Liv. 40. 40; 4²· 3, 10). was evidently in
existence in 652, B. C. 92 (Jul. Obsequens,
ς 11 3 citing, probably from Livy, a
prodigy belonging to that year), and ap-
pears to be alluded to, as still standing,
even by Vitruvius (3. 3, 2). It may, how-
ever, liave perished after that date, and
the only inscriptions to ‘F ortuna’ with
this title appear to be spurious: see Orelli
here and on Inscr. 174 6.

7. apud Antium. Tffis town being
especially the seat of the worship of F or
tune (Hor. Od. 1.35‚ 1), anothepr temple
to that. goddess may well have existed

there, besides the famous one of the J

Orell. 1738. 1740), but so obscur-ed by it
as to be forgotten.

8. iuris. ,Romani esse. This is

inserted to show that such an offering ⁷

could be dedicated as lawsully at Antium

cp. c. 60, 1

as at Rome. W hen the Italians became ;

Roman citizens, it appears to have tested ”
with the pontiffs to decide what ‘munici- 4

υ

palia sacra' should be kept up: see Mar-- .’

‘pontifex maximus¹ was by his office -.
