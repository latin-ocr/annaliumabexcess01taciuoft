the fifteenth century; the supposition of so'many felicitous accidents
will be generally conceded to pass the bounds of reasonable probability.
Most of the following confirmations will be already more or less
familiar to students, from the notice of them by Orelli, Nipperdey, and
other editors, in the places to which they severally belong :—
1. Germanicus is stated to have been augur¹‚ flamen ², and im-

⁸perator³ ; and all these titles are confirmed ⁴.
2. His eldest son Nero is stated to have been espoused to the

daughter of Creticus Silanus ⁵. An inscription gives the name ‘Iunia
Silani [f.‚ spon]sa Neronis Caes[aris] ⁸.'

3. The honours decreed to Germanicus at his death are enumerated ⁷,
and in another place it is stated that those decreed to Drusus were in
the main the same ⁸. The remains of tablets recording these decrees,
though extremely fragmentary, appear to suggest confirmation of some
of the details, such as the insertion of the name in the Salian hymn,
the exhibition of the effigy at the ‘ Circenses‚' and the erectiori of arches
(Jani) at three different places ⁹.

4‘. L. Apronius, and P. Cornelius Dolabella, stated to have been at
different times proconsuls of Africa ¹⁰, are shown to have been so by
coins struck there under their permission Π.

5. It is stated that the tribunitian power, though never given to
Germanicus, was afterwards given to Drusus, about a year before his
death ¹². This title, absent on all records of Germanicus, appears on
coins of Drusus, but without record of more than a second year of
office ¹²³.

6. It is stated, that in the inscription of a statue dedicated by Julia
Augusta to Augustus near the theatre of Marcellus, her name was
placed before that of Tiberius ¹⁴. The Praenestine Calendar gives <with
a date) the fact, and the locality of this dedication, and places the
names in this order, thus apparently following the original inscription ¹⁶.

7. An inscription ¹⁶ confirms the statement that Drusus, son of Ger-
manicus, held the honorary office of praefectus urbi ¹⁷.

8. The statement, that Smyrna was chosen as the site of the temple
to be erected by the cities of Asia to Tiberius, his mother, and the
