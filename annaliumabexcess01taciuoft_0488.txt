Tiberio erga pecuniam alienam diligentia suit. Sosia in exilium

quartam accusatoribus secundum necessitudinem legis, cetera

sapientem virum fuisse comperior: nam pleraque ab saevis
adulationibus aliorum in melius flexit. neque tamen tempera-
menti egebat, cum aequabili auctoritate et gratia apud Tiberium
viguerit. unde dubitare cogor, fato et sorte nascendi, ut cetera, 5

obsequium pergere iter ambitione ac periculis vacuum. at Mes· 8
salinus Cotta haud minus claris maioribus, sed animo diversus,

given to him in 3. 18, 2. ⁸ Diligentia ' is
here equivalent to ‘ studium,’ but used
with some irony.

,2. pellitur. This, and ‘ concessit' be-
low, are used to express the sentences
advocated by these senators: cp. 3. 2 3,
2, etc.

partem: cp. 3. 17, 8. Nipp. is prob-
ably right in thinking that the property

-of Sosia alone is meant, that of Silius
having been already disposed os.

3. liberis, One of them was the C.
Silius of 11. 5, 3, etc.

Μ’. Lepidus: cp. note on 3. 32, 2.

4. quartam. On such ellipses, cp. In-
trod. v. ξ 80. ‘ Quarta’ is thus used in
Quint. 8. 5, 19; Dig. 5. 2, 8; 5. 4, 3.

legis. The law would be the ‘lex
Iulia de maiestate,' passed by Augustus.
If the derivation most commonly assigned
to ‘quadruplator’ is correct, one fourth
would seem to be the usual reward os in-
formers; but it is evidently here a legal
‘minimum,' limiting the discretion (cp.
6. 47, 1) of the senate ; and the ‘lex Papia
Poppaea' prescribed, till the time of Nero,
a higher proportion (Suet. Ner. ιο). The

gardless of,' and compares ‘ a fortuitis vel
naturalibus causis ' (H. 1. 86, 4).

7. neque tamen, etc.‚ ‘nor yet (though
apt to take an independent course) was
he wanting in respect of sels-control, as
is shown by his having uniformly enjoyed ,
the respect and favour , of Tiberius!
‘ Aequabilis ’ appears to have this soree in
H. 4. 5, 4 (‘cunctis vitae officiis aequa-
bilis’). as also the adv. in 15. 21, 5
(⁴ aequabilius atque constantius provinciae
regentur ²) : cp. Cic. N. D. 2, 93 Sall. Jug.
53, 1, etc. Nipp. would take ‘egebat'
as in 13. 3, 3, etc.‚ but the meaning given
above appears more suitable to this pas-
sage, and supported by 12. 66, 2 (‘ mini-
strorum egens’). Lepidus is similarly
described in 6. 27, 4, and illustrationis of
his discretiori will be found in 1. 13. 2;
3· 35, ²3 50. “

9. unde dubitare cogor, etc.‚ i. e. the
success of such a man leads me to think
that character, as well as destiny. has to
do with the regard or aversion of princes.
On the sentiment, cp. Introd. iv. p. 22.

1 1 . abruptam contumaciam,‘perilons
defiance.’ That this is the m

enormous sums. sometimes given can be
inserted from 16. 33, 4; H. 4. 42, 5.

6. comperior.. The sentence is taken
from Sall. (see Introd. v. ξ 97, 1), and the
deponent form is elsewhere only found in
Ter. And. 5. 3, 31 ; Sall. Jug. 108, 3, and
in late prose.

¹nam pleraque . . . . flexit. This
seems best taken, with Freinsh.‚ to mean
‘ he modified many sentences in an oppo-
site direction to the cruel servility of
others! Nipp. takes ‘ab' to mean ‘re-

ming of
‘abruptus' seems suggested by ‘ periculis'
below, and by ‘in abruptum tractus‘ (H.
1. 48, 7), ‘ per abrupta ambitiosa morte
inclaruerunt ’ (Agr. 42, 5). The metaphor
is suggested by such a sense as that in 2. 5 5.
3. On the sentiment, cp. Introd. iv. p. 2ο.

1 2. Messalinus Cotta: cp. 2. 32, 2, etc.
This decree was still in force in the time
of Ulpian, who dates it (Dig. 1316. 4, 2)

in the year of Cotta’s consulship (see 3. ,

2, 5). Compare the debate bearing on
this subject (3. 33, 34).
