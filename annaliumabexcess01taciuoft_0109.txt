 

ROME UNDER A UGUSTUS ΛΝΒ TIBERIUS. 91

‚t Under these were grouped the 265⁸ vici¹, 'or quasi- parochial corporations,
, choosing ach their four wardens or ‘vico-magistri& whose duties,
though mainly religious‚ were also in part constabulary⁸‚ at least till the
institution in 756, Λα). 6, of the‘ vigiles⁰ , who were so distributed that
each cohort, 1000 strong, had watch and ward os two regions ⁸, to guard
. from fite and robbery; both os which were still rife enough in crowded
districts, and streets lit only by the poor passenger’s lamp-wick, and now
md then by the rich man's torch train‘. Besides the ‘ vigiles,’ the urban
and praetorian guards were in reserve, is needed, and the police magis·
tracy, beyond such powers as r'emained to aediles and other magistrates',
tested with the city praesect&
The principate os Tiberius seems on the whole to mark the period
when the populace are least considered. They take the oath os allegiance
,athisaccession' , aud then seem to retire from prominence. They have
no votes to sell ¹⁰, the general tie οι· clientship would thereby become
more unmeaning, and the rabble are not yet the ‘ clientela Caesaris!
Their only interest is in their breed and their amusements ¹¹, and in both
they seem ιο have their grievances. To keep famine at bay is indeed felt
by the princeps to be his most arduous task ¹¹, and to require efforts far
exoeeding those of Augustus ¹⁸. Still. the cry sor bread, finding expression
at the great popular gatherings os the games, is fierce and even menacing¹‘;
in the general poverty even a small tax seems burdensome ¹⁸5 and,
beyond doing his utmost for the food supply, Tiberius keeps them ιιι a
distance. The legacies of Augustus are pald grudgingly¹⁸, ‘ congiaria’
are infrequent¹⁷3 and, though the people have the cheap daily lounge
of their public baths, thanks ιο Maecenas and Agrippa, and their⁴ cir·
censes ‘and new ludi Augustalesn 'yet the presence of the princeps
st their αωοβ, is vouchsased at all, is no longer genial¹', and the sangui·
nary excitement of gladiatorial shows so rare, that crowds flock to one

given by private speculation in the neighbourhood ¹⁰. Their moods nre
schooled¹¹ und rebuked· by edim, their murmurs treated ss vapour ¹⁸,
