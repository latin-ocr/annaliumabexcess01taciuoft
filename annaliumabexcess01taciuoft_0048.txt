30 [ΝΜ OD UCTJON.

Among the features of the Latinity of what is called the ,silver age,
one of the most prominent is the introduction into prose of words and
forms of expression from the great classic poets‚ who had by that time
become the text-books of every grammar-school ¹. That this extended
to all kinds of prose composition, may be illustrated from the fact that
out of a list, gathered from Tacitus, of nearly 100 words, more or less
frequent in Augustan poetry, but absent from Augustan or classic prose,
more than half had already won a place in intermediate prose literature,
mostly in the plain, matter—of-fact descriptions of the elder Pliny ¹.
Another such list might easily be framed from Livy, to show by a com-
parison with Caesar, or even Sallust, the influence of poetic diction on
historical prose, even in the latter part of the Augustan age itself.

Partly through this adoption of poetic language, partly through the
increasing taste for what was Greek, as such ³, Latinity had also become
more tolerant of Greek words and grammatica] Graecisms.

In Tacitus, the first of these general tendencies is abundantly pro-
minent⁴ 3 the latter he may probably have looked upon as a corruption,
as'he shows no disposition to add to the Graecisms or Greek words
already in use ⁶. His earliest treatise, the ‘Dialogus,' shows even
a 'reaction in the direction of Ciceronian Latinity⁶; his later writings‚
while showing less and less trace of Cicero ⁷, have acquired so marked

’ an individuality of style, that even a fragment, long lurking unsuspected

in the pages of Sulpicius Severus, has been claimed for Tacitus with
good grounds on internal evidence alone ⁸.
The special qualities of his style are no doubt due, in no small

⁴ measure, to his professional career. As the first forensic orator of the

day, we might assume that he had perfected such gifts as were pre-
scribed to a pleader by the prevailing fashion; and he has himself
described to us the difference between the rolling periods of Ciceronian
eloquence and the style demanded in his own age, when jury and
listeners soon wearied of a long harangue, were impatient of the
speaker’s preamble‚ and recalled him peremptorily from a digression ς
so that brevity had become the soul of wit, rapidity and incisive bril-
liancy the qualities most sure to reward the pains taken to acquire them.
He tells us of ,pupils listening eagerly, and reporting to their friends
