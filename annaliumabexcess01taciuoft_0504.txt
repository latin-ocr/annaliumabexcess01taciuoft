486 CORNELII TA CITI ANNALIUM [A.U.C. 7⁷8·

libros per aediles cremandos censuere patres: set manserunt,
occultati et editi. quo magis socordiam eorum inridere libet,6

aevi memoriam. nam contra punitis ingeniis gliscit auctoritas,
neque aliud externi reges aut qui eadem saevitia usi sunt, nisi
dedecus sibi atque illis gloriam peperere.

trias? an est una illa patria communis'
(Cic. Legg. 2. 2). ‘Enim,’ the conjecture
of Halm for the MS. ‘ eum,’ is now gener-
ally adopted rather> than the marginal
‘ cum,' read by older editors.

2. septuagensimum, a round number
for the sixty-sixth year.

3. imaginibus suis. Besides their
preservation in families (see on 3. 76, 5),
we hear of a bronze statue of Brutus pre-
served at Mediolanum by order of Augus-
tus (Plut. comp. Dionis curn Bruto, 5).
A few busts, and several of his coins exist,
some of which bear his head; others, as
also those of Cassius, have such inscrip—
tions as ‘ Libertas‚' ‘Eid. Mart,' and ap-
propriate symbols: see Dio, 47. 25, 33
Coheu, i. p. 26-29.

noscuntur = ‘ adgnoscuntur ε ’ 50
‘nosco crines‚’ etc. (Verg. Aen. 6, 810):
c . 2. 28, 1.

p4. ne . . . quidem. The MS. ‘ nee . . .
quidem' 1185 been rejected by nearly all
editors (after J. F. Gron.) here and in 14.
35, 2; also generally, though with less
certainty, in H. 4. .38, 2.

5. rependit.. The MS. has ‘repend-
unt,' which has been rejected by all edi-
tors as an assimilation to ‘;deerunt ' pos-
teritas,’ however equivalent to ‘posteri‘
(cp.'.,·;3193 H-·11²· Agr-46‚4)
not appearing to be anywliere used with
a plural verb

6. set. 0118111.Τ110 MS. has ‘sedet
0118111,’ from which it appears possible
11181 the true reading is ‘sed et‚' and

‘etiam’ a gloss.

7. vitam abstinentia finivit. Senem
(Cous. ad Marc. 22, 6) gives a touching
account of his concealment of his purpose

from his daughter Marcia till the fourth .

day, and descgribes the disappointment of
the accusers at finding their prey had
escaped them.

8. libros, etc. M. Seneca (Praef. Con·
trov. Lib. 10, 5) speaks of this penalty as
first devised against ’1 . Labienus, probably
in 765, A.D. 12 (Dio, 56. 27, 1). This
duty appears to have been considered to
belong to the aediles in virtue of their
‘cura urbis' (Introd. vi. p. 76) but to
have been delegated by them to the ‘trae-
viri capitales' (Agr. 2, 1).

their publication, as also that of the works
of T. Labienus and Cassius Severus (e.
21), permitted by Gaius (Suet. Cal. 16).
socordiam . . . . inridere libet, the
action of Nero (14. 50, 2) and of Domi-
tian (Agr. 2, 1) is especially alluded to

14. postulandis reis continu-mix in-

cessantly occupied with accusations: This

ὁ expression is used of a person in 11. 5, 1,

as here of a personification. The con-
struction is not elsewhere found, but ap—
pears to be an abl. of respect, analogous
to ‘equis assignandis . . . diligentes‘ (Cic.
Rep. 2. 20, 32), etc.

15. praefectum urbis. This survival
of the old representative of the magistrates
during their absence (⁸ praefectura urbis
ob ferias Latinas ') coexisted with the new
and permanent office instituted by Augus-
