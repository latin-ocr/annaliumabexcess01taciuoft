has stated. Such a decree, besides be' ‚
no doubt, based upon the ‘lex‘ itse

(see c. 16, 1), would also be intended to
increase the demand for land, to the
advantage of debtors who had estates
to sell; and to remedy the scarcity of
money, partly ἕῇτοειῖ1 gh lyalnps 1?ng themsliien

‘curae‚’ ‘angustiae familiares’ (4. 15, 33

11. 7, 33 12. 52, 4).
5. commoto, etc. The capitalists had

all broken the law, and had to bring
theiraffairs into harmony with it in
eighteen months. All illegal loans, in
other words, a large proportion of all

loans‚ were thus called in.
4. et quia. Another independent

cause of the scarcity of money is added.

The events of the last year had led to so
many condemnations and confiscations
for conspiracy or treason, that the treasu-
ries were gorged, and the money in
circulation proportionately diminished.

as the aerarium, in respect of such sums,

possible that ‘ob hoc’ should be read,-

Plaut. Most. 3. 1, 101 (‘faenus creditum’),
etc. A more full statement of this decree
ι is given in Suet. Tib. 48, ‘ut faeneratores
duas patrimonii partes in solo collocarent

Tacitus may perhaps have considered
such a clause to be implied in what he

7. sed creditores, etc. The decree of
the senate did not preclude the ordinary
right of a creditor to call in his debts as
and when he pleased. This they exer-
cised by calling in, not only two-thirds,
but all debts at once in full3 audit was
a point of honour for the debtor to main—
tain his credit. On the other hand, the
obligation of the capitalist, to bring his
affairs into conformity with the law, had
eighteen months to run. They could
thus force the debtor to realise at once,
with all the disadvantages of scarcity of
money, and of flooding the market with
estates and property for sale; and could
themselves bide their time for bargains,
to purchase land at leisure' m accordance
with the law or decree.

from one money lender to another with
entreaties sor money or time; then the

11. copiam vendendi, etc. With the
gerund,‘ copia ’generally means ‘oppor-
tunity‚’ as ‘ mutuandi copia ' below: here
it appears to mean ‘ abundance ' of sales 3
