238 CORNELII TACJTJ ANNALIUM [A.u.c. 768.

circum milites, incertus signorum ordo, utque tali in tempore sibi
quisque properus et lentae adversum imperia aures, inrumpere
Germanos iubet, clamitans ‘en Varus eodemque iterum sato
vinctae legiones! ' simul haec et cum delectis scindit agmenfi
5 equisque maxime vulnera ingerit. illi sanguine suo et lubrico 6
paludum lapsantes excussis rectoribus disicere obvios, proterere
iacentes. plurimus circa aquilas labor, quae neque ferri adversum 7
ingruentia tela neque figi limosa humo poterant. Caecina dum 8
sustentat aciem, suffosso equo delapsus circumveniebatur, ni
10 prima legio sese opposuisset. iuvit hostium aviditas, omissae
caede praedam sectantium ; enisaeque legiones vesperascente die
in aperta et solida. neque is miseriarum finis. struendum vallum, 10
petendus agger, amissa magna ex parte per quae egeritur humus

pected ‘in caeno,¹ etc, but such an
abl. may be regarded as quasi-instru-
mental: It seems necessary to suppose
the ‘’fossae to be natural holes or fis-
sures; a meaning somewhat supported
by Be11.Afr. 50, 4 (where the word
means a ravine), but hardly so by the
rustic proverb ‘cantherium in fossam’
(Liv. 23. 47, 6), which Nipp. also cites.
1. utque. We have here, as Nipp.
ints out, two concurrent constructions
with ‘ut.’ The ‘ ut’ before ‘ haesere,' in
the sense of ‘when,' extends its force to
‘aures; ' and the parenthetical ‘ut tali
in tempore’ (ε’ ut fie1i solet tali' in tem·
pore·..‚;’cp2821 H.3.,71 43 G.2‚;4
22, 1; Agr. ιι, 1) is interposed. The
expression ‘tali in tempore’ (2. 84, 33
16. 26, 8) may be a reminiscence of Lucr.

ι s9i4bi properus. Cp. ‘sibi ..

H. 1. 13. 3.

3. eodemque. The MS. has ‘et
eodemque.’ In two similar errors in the
second Medicean MS., ‘argenti et aurique'
(H. 4. 53, 4), ‘Gallias et Germaniasque·
(H. 4. 54‚1)‚an accidental transposition
appears not improbable, and the ‘ que‘
may well have belon ed originally to

‘argenti’ and to ‘Ga lias) Here pos
sibly some word after‘ et' has been lost:
„ possibly, as Ritter suggests, the copyist
of some earlier MS. overlooked‘ que' in
an abbreviation, and added‘ et.'
.„t.5²·¹‡‚⁰·‘²1?‚2 ἕῖἓῗ-ῗεέῗὲιῖ ῗὲἓξὲἰέιὲιίῐῖ
older editions read· victae? which would
be a natural exaggeration of the success

describedin c. 64, 4. On the other hand,

.tendentes'

‘vinctae’ would resemble the lan

of Calgacus, ‘vinctos di nobis tradi-
derunt' g(Agr. 32, 3); and‘ velut vincti’
is used of troops encumbered by baggage
and sticky ground (H. 1. 79, 3).

simul haee et; a poetical expres-
sion (Stat Theb. 2, 6 59). The usual
formula‘ simul et. ‚et’ is modified to

‘simul. .et’ in4. 25, 2; H. 3. 13, 3;
Sall J ug 97 4·

6. lapsantes: cp.
Vergil (Aen. 2, 551), and apparently not
in prose before Tacitus.

7. ferri adversum. The MS. has
‘ “ adverss1'' ferri: the double commas
being added by a later hand in different
ink (see Pfitzner, p. 15). The trans-
position taken to be indicated by them is
now generally adopted. Otherwise ⁸ ad-
versum serri' must be supposed to take
an accusative, like such compounds as

inrumpere' (c. 48, 4). etc.

8. figi . . humo: cp. ‘haesere
caeno fossisque? above, ‘figere animo'
Agr. 45, 5, etc.

9. suffosso equo: so in 2. 11, 4, and
v. l. inVerg. Aen. 11, 671. Cp.‘ equis

,ilia subsodere’ Liv. 42. 59, 3

11 vesperascente die; also ιιι 16. 34,
13 H. 2. 49, 2. On the variety of ex-
pressions sor this fact used by Tacitus,
see Introd. v. 5 93.

1 2. aperta et solida. This again seems
different from either of the solid spots
before mentioned, and to be altogether
beyond the morass traversed by the

‘pontes’ Cp. c. 68, 4 ‘non hic silvas
nec paludes.’

13. agger, ‘ material for the mound ε ’
