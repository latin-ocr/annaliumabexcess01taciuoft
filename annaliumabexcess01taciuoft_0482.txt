in the time of Claudius (11. 4. 2, etc.).
Another expulsion is recorded in the
time of Nero (13. 25, 4).

1. Idem annus . . . adficit, repeated
in 6'. 45, 1 z cp. Introd. v. ξ 7,=.

alterum ex geminis: see on 2, 84, 1.
The child was about four years old.

3. Lucilius Longus. An incidental
notice in Kal. Amitern. (Orell. Insc. ii.
p. 397) shows that Longus was cos. suff.
with Creticus Silanus (cp. 2. 43, 3) in 760,
A. D. 7.

4. unusque e senatoribuS, ‘the only
senator! Two knights. who also ac-
companied Tiberius to Rhodes, are men-

tioned in 6. 10, 2.

5. censorium funus. The expression
is repeatedin 6. 27, 2; 13. 2, 6; H. 4.
47, 2. As public funerals were under-
taken by contract (cp. on 3. 48, 1), and con-
tracts in the name of the state were in re-
publican times usually let· by the censors,
it is generally thought that, though cen-
sors had ceased to exist, ‘ censorium
funus' is still a synonym for ‘ funus publi-
cum,’ the one expression (in 6. 1 1, 7)
being apparently equivalent to the other
(in 6. 27, 2). It has also been taken to
mean a public funeral of the highest kind,
such as would have been given to one
who-had filled the-censorship, the highest
{arsizifflfjfflssfiffifflfssssffi‘assss‘}
(13. 2, 6), who really had been censor.

forum Augusti, one of the series
of imperial Fora north east of the old
Forum, between the Capitol and Quir inal.

‚In its centre was the Temple of Mars

Ultor (cp. 2. 64, 2), and many statues of
great men stood in its porticoes (Suet.
Ααξ 31). Respecting its site and re-
mains, see Burn, Rome, etc. p. 131.

6. etiam tum. A conti-ast is implied
to the·later prevalence of private trials
(cp.6. 10, 2; 11. 2, 1, etc), andisillus-
trapted by the extreme case of bringing a
charge against Caesar’s own procurator
before the senate. That such persor s
were usually tried before the princeps,
would appear from 13 33,1; Dial.7, 1.

7. procurat-or: see note on c. 6, 5;
2. 47, 3, etc. The existence os these fi’scal
officers‚ even in all senatorial provinces, is
attested by numerous inscriptions (see
Marquardt‚ Staatsv. i. p. 414); but the
context shows that their position was sar
lower at present in these than in the
Caesarian provinces, and wholly different
from that of procurators who were actual
govemors: see Introd. vii. p. 99.

8. eausam dixerit, sc. ‘apud eos,’
supplied from‘ apud quos!

9.. servitia. The force of‘ familiares’
extends also to this word ; the ⁸ pecuniae’
are the αὐτοκρατορικὰ χρήματα of Dio (57.
23, 5), who states that procurators could
then only prosecute their claims before
the ordinary courts. An extension is
given to their jurisdiction under Claudius
(see on 12. 60, 1), and they become quite
independent os the proconsul: cp. Dig. 1.
16, 9 ‘si fiscalis pecuniaria causa sit,

quae ad procuratorem principis respicit, .

melius fecerit (proconsul) si abstineat?

10. praetoris, ‘of a governor: 'used Ξ

here as a general term (cp. note on 1. 74,

1), though the proconsul of this province ¹

was always of consular rank.
