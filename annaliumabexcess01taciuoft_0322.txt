Tiberius demoverat Suria Creticum Silanum, per adfinitatem
connexum Germanico, quia Silani filia Neroni vetustissimo libe-
rorum eius pacta erat, praefeceratque Cn. Pisonem, ingenio
violentum et obsequii ignarum, insita ferocia a patre Pisone, qui
civili bello resurgentes in Africa partes acerrimo ministerio

governed Cilicia (see c. 78, 33 80, 1),

Iudaea. This country was then
under the procurator Valerius Gratus
(Jos. Ant. 18. 2, 2). This petition for
reduction of tribute appears to be not
otherwise known to us.

Drusus about twenty- -nine. See Introd. ix.

5 quae mari dividuntur. In the
parallel expression ‘quiequid armorum
mari dirimitur’ (Η. 1. 76, 5), the Asiatic
and African provinces are meant. Maee-
donia and Achaia would also fall within
such a definition, and the latter was visit-
ed by Germanicus (c. 53), though prob·
ably not officially. Egypt, though seem-
ingly within the terms of the decree, was
not meant to be included (c. 59 3)

maiusque imperium. This ap-
pears, though not distinetly stated as
such, to have been an extension to the
East of the‘ proconsulare imperium ’held
by Germanicus 111 the West (see 1. 14, 4).
Ity would thus naturally be an‘ imperium
maius‚’ not only to that of‘ legati pro·
praetore? but also, as was that of Caesar
(Introd. vi. p. 69), to that os ordinary
proconsuls. Gaius Caesar, whose mis-
sion was the most natural precedent to
have ,been followed, is stated to have held
this rank (Zon. 10. 36, 1539 c); and such

may also be supposed to have been the
position of Agrippa in the δεκαετὴς 8101-
κησις stated (Jos. Ant. 16. 3, 3) to have
been held by him in the East (see
Momms. on Mon. Anc. p. 113): also
Corbulo subsequently had a power which
is compared to that formerly given to Cn.
Pompeius (cp. 15. 25, 6).

6. sorte . . . obtinerent. A general
designation of the proconsuls of senato-
rial provinces: see on 3. 32, a, etc.

him by Seneca (de Ira, 1.18,3-6), who Ῑ
illustrates it by his unjust and passionate ,

must have been that of Africa, where the
proconsul had a legion under him.
