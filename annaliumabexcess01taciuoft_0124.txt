106 INTRODUCTION.

turion ¹. Such of their duties as are still traceable can hardly be gener-
ally characterized23 and this rank becomes hardly so much one of
military promotion‚ as a ‘tirocinium' for young men of the highest
rank ⁸, and a stepping-stone to the quaestorship and senate ⁴.

1. ‘ Vexillarii‚’ or ‘ veterani sub vexillo retenti.' Augustus had ordained
that the legionary soldier should be dismissed with gratuities after a term
of service originally fixed at sixteen ⁵, and later at twenty years’ service ⁶. ,.
Probably the same events which led to the enrolment of additional
legions, combined with the exhaustion of the ‘aerarium militare ’ξ’ led
him to postpone his obligations by a characteristic fiction3 by which the
veteranS, though removed from the legion and released from the oath,
were kept together under separate colours‚ perhaps exempted from camp
duties and reserved for battle ⁸, but awaiting indefinitely their final dis-
charge and reward. The words ‘ vexillum,' ‘ vexillarii‚' and ‘ vexillatio,'
though often used of any legionary detachment under separate command ⁹,
appear to have a special application to these troops who are distinguished
from the legions by Tacitus in several places ¹⁰. They might be quar-
tere'd with ¹¹, or separated from their legions ¹2, and, perhaps by combina-
tion, are sometimes 1000 strong ¹⁸ 3 but if the number 500, the only
estimate of such a battalion given in these books, may be treated as the
normal strength of those belonging to one legion ¹⁴, it would agree with
the computation of Hyginus, who reckons them as equivalent to an
extra cohort ¹⁵.

2. ‘ Cohortes civium Romanorum ' are mentioned in several inscriptions,
v usually as volunteers, frequently as Italians 16; and may probably have
been generally formed of such as chose a military profession, and who
lived in other districts than those from which the home army was raised.
There appear to have been at one time at least thirty-two such cohorts ¹⁷5
