Lex Caducarz'a.

The second half of this law is thus entitled by Heineccius ; who makes it
consist of fifteen Chapters. No fragments of them are preserved, and the
restoration of this part of the law is much less certain in its details; but
it is known generally to have dealt with the subjectos lapsed inheritances‚
and the proportions and conditions under which they became public pro-
perty. All that is known of their provisions is fully given and explained
by Heineccius (pp. 357, foll.).

Such inheritances or legacies as could not be taken by the persons to

whom they were devised accrued firstly to conjoint legatees of the same s

¹ An oath not to marry, exactedby a
pantrgrffinvivtffisnggppp{elaeggssgssther-intlaw
gud son-in-law, to be annulled by death or

lvorce.

³ Those absent on the public service to
be exempt from the ⁴penalties of the law.

¹ The senate might legalise an otherwise
illegal marriage, as between a senator and
freedwoman.

⁵ This law fixed the share 'of dower to
be returned to the wife on divorce, and
was intended to, discourage divorce by
making it entail loss.

⁶ Preserved by Marcianus.

⁷ The text of this section is given as
conceived by Heineccius from Ulp. Fr. Tit.
xviia, and other sources. ‘Caelebs’ is
‹lemed to be an unmarried man between

twenty and sixty‚ or an unmarried woman '
between twenty and fifty (see above, cap. J
iii„ and Poste, Gaius, p. 264). The ex- j
ception, within which inhen'tances or s
legacies were allowed to aecrue, extended ,
to ascendants and descendants as far as the ⁷
third degree. - “

⁸ The text of this chapter is a restoration ,
like the former. The pains and penalties
of celibacy and childlessness were abol· J
ished by Constantine in A.D. 320 (see ³?
Poste on Gaius, p. 265). j

⁹ Cp. cap. xi. The general object of
these seven chaptexs was to define the 1³
rights of the patronus over the person or j,
property of his married freedman and
freedwoman. Their provisions are ex-
plained by Heineccius (Comm. pp. 344— ,
356) x see also Poste, Gaius, p. 323, fon.
