remum of those who seu with Vama or at best barren victorias in the

ξ field ⁸, balanced by disastrous retreats ⁸, and entailing untold requisitions

’ξ on Gaul ⁴, was recalled from an all but completed conquest ⁶.

The gener-al foreign policy of such a ruler naturally finds little favour
with a historian who looked back with fondness to the military glories of
the old republic ⁰, and was writing when the star of conquest was again
in the ascendant, when the eagles had advanced to the Carpathians and
the Pruffi, the sseet to the Persian gulf and the Indian Ocean. His
diadain is natural for the old ‘ narrow limits of empire ζ’ sor the ⁶ timid
or envioua' advice of Augustus ⁸, and for a prince who ‘ cared not to
extend the frontier‚' and under whom ‘peace was slightly if at all dis-
. turbed “.’ Yet thia pohey, while prudent and consistent, was not undig·
nilied. The civil war of Arminius and Maroboduus¹⁰ fully attests the
visdom of leaving Germany to its internal conflicta ¹¹. The anxiety to
preserve order ¹¹, and to settle difficulties without recourse to arms ¹⁸, will
commend itself no less than the just partition of Thrace under its own
princes ¹⁴5 the acquisition of Cappadocia with advantage both to its own
inhabitants and to the Roman people ¹³; and the maintenance of prestige
in the East without open breach with Parthia ς while Armenia is secured
to the Roman interest through a prince of Roman sympathies, yet not
too Roman for his subJects ¹⁰.

Amin, the severe punishment of governors for extortion will be
generally held decerving of more praise than is awarded by the historiast,
who, even when candidly admitting a case of proved guilt in this respect,
appears to lay no stress upon it ¹⁷. Nor can we share his apparent regret
that lugeas was not laviahed on the needy descendant of the Hortensii ¹⁸;
the more so as it is admitted that Tiberius eared not, at least at this time,
to enrich himself ¹⁹, or to be sparing of bounty to persona ¹⁹ or communi-
tiea ¹¹ on Just occasion.

Amin, when all his resourcea were suained to seed the people ¹⁸, we
should hardly blame the eoommy, even if we are allowed to imagine no
better motive‚ from which their mere amusements were curtailed ¹⁸.
