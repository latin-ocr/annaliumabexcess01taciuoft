J lav ¹. Such power is derivable from that exercised in old times by
,³3 those who held the ‘imperium' of the state, and the authority of the
:¹ senate to ‘give laws' in its name ¹. Many such imperial ‘leges datae'
ἓ are mentioned, and fragments of some are preserved⁸; many of them
giving colonial or municipal rights ⁴, or ordaining statutes for such
5 communities ⁸, Again‚ the citizenship, formerly given, as a rule, by
plebiscite, but osten also through authority committed to commanders,
as Marius, Pompeius, etc-⁸, is now sormally given by the ‘princepS‚’
both to individuals ², usually as the reward of service in the auxi-
liary forces ⁸, and also to whole communitiesj. The legal sore} os
’Ὺ these edicts and rescripts, though strictly limited to the life os the
princeps, was in most cases permanent through confirmation os his
¹ ‘acta' aster his death.
, Again, by his indirect and direct judicial power, he became practically
Μαι· sote sounmin os justice. Resides framing the usas or ‘iudices selectvae'
’ and regulating their duties¹¹, Augustus had, in 726, mc. 28, ‘and osten
afterwards· selected the ‘praetor urbanuS,' ⁴ extra sortem ¹¹! The prin-
ceps frequently sat as assessor at the praetor's siden, and even in absence
appears to have been treated as present by the fiction of a ‘calculus
Mixoeme’ deposited in his name ¹⁴. Tiberius constantly presides in
person at the senatorial high court os justice‘u, influencing it by his
manner ¹⁸ no less than his vote; and exercises his power of intercession,
whether in refusing to admit the case ¹⁷, or in modisying the sentence,
either at the time¹⁴, or before its formal enrolment¹⁰. The power os
pardon, vested to some extent in every magistrate ²⁰, and especially
reserved by the old constitution sor the people ¹¹, has now passed wholly
to Caesar’, as in some sense their representative.
