ob scelus Antonii. Tacitus cares
to explain only their alienation from
Rome. Artavasdes I was son of Tigranes
Ι (the king known in the campaigns of
Lucullus and Pompeius), and had reigned
some twenty years before his capture by
Antonius in 720, Rc. 34: Dio, 49. 39, 43
Vell. 2. 82, 3. He was put to death by
Cleopatra, after Actium, to win the al-
liance of the Median king, his enemy
(Dio, 51- 5, 5)-

2. filius Artaxias. He had been made
king by the military chiefs on the capture
of his father, and though at first defeated,
had made good his position in the follow-
ing year: see Dio, 49· 39, 6; 40, 1; 44,
4. He put to death all Romans in his
dominions (Id. 51. 16, 2).

nem tradere? Josephus (Ant. 15. 4, 3)
represents Artaxias as expelled by Tibe-
rius. The date is that of the restoration
of the standards (see note on c. 1, 1) ;
and. the statement of Augustus above,
that Armenia lay at his mercy, is magni-
fied into a conquest by Horace (Epp. 1.
12, 16) and Velleius (2. 94, 2), and in
coins of this date (see Momms. on Mon.
Aue. p. 77), bearing the legend ⁸ Armenia
capta!

9.gllrtavasdes. This prince is un·
noticed in Mon. Anc. which speaks gene—
rally (v. 28) of a period of revolt (‘gentem
postea desciscentem et rebellantem '). A
solitary coin is however extant, bearing
on the obverse the head and title of Ar-
tavasdes, and on the reverse the head of
Augustus, with the inscription θεοῦ Καίσα-
ρος Εὐεργέτους which must belong to the
son of Ariobarzanes (see on 5 3) or to
this king, to whom Prof. Percy Gardner
(Num. Chron. N. S. Imp. 9-15) inclines
to refer it. Nipp. thin s he may have
been a brother of Artaxias and Tigranes
ΙΙ. Tigranes and Erato, who had been
set aside sor Artavasdes. appear to have
inflicted this ‘ elades’ and driven him out
with Parthian aid. The only evidence
os date is supplied by the statement that
Tiberius was to have been despatched to
deal with the Armenian revolt after the
death of Tigranes, but for his retirement
to Rhodes, 748, B. C. 6 (Dio, 55. 9. 43

Affairs were thus left unsettled till the
mission of Gaius.

10. Gaius caesar. He was in the
East from 753, uc. 1, till his death on
Feb. 21, 757, A. D. 4. Tigranes had fal-
len in battle with his neighbours, Erato
again retired‚ and Phraataces was induced
to withdraw his support (Dio, 55. 10. a,
