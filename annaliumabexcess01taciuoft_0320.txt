their frontier (c. 19, 3; 20, 2); so that
this does not depend upon the reading
in c. 8, 4, etc.

1. ad Albim: cp, c. 22, 1.

2. simulacra.. Thus a plan os Sar-

41. 28, 10), and many 'such representa-

the addition of ‘intuentium ’ seems to

him, one was yet unborn: see c. 54, 1.

5. reputantibus. Nipp. explains this
as abl. abs. (see Introd. v. § 31 c), and
takes ‘suberat’ absolutely, as in 3. 30,

avunculum. Marcellus (see 1. 3, 1)
was half-brother to Antonia, the mother
of Germanicus. He was twenty, Drusus
thirty years old at his death.

9. trecenos. The ‘congiaria ’ of Au-

after Antonius had set Archelaus on the
throne, in 718, Β. e. 3⁶ (Dio, 49. 32, 3).
He was descended from the famous
general of Mithridates (Dio, 1.1.). Au·
gustus had confirmed and added to his
dominions (Id. 54. 9, 2), and Tiberius had

once defended him against the complaint .

of his subjects (Id. 57. 17, 3). He bears
on his coins the title Philopatris.

properly so called is separated by Mts.

Minor, which was not added to the pro-
