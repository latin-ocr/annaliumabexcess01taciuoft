mox, i. e. aster he became princeps.
The word is used of considerable intervals
of time in 1. 13, 33 14. 9, 3, etc.

Passieni. C. Passienus Crispus, twice
consul (Pl. N. H. 16. 44, 91, 242),
the second time being in 797, Α. D. 44
(Inscr. Henzen 5214), married first Domi-
tia, sister of Agrippina’s first husband (see
on 13. 19, 4), and, aster divorcing her,
was married to Agrippina herself, who is
said to have poisoned him. Nero inherited
his property (Suet. Ner. 6). His oratory
is highly praised by L. Seneca (Qu. Nat.
21'132126133112⁵<³}{i¹1³2 ⁰1f1 ἓίῐξαὲξῗαιὲὲιῖῗέ
who places him next to Pollio and Cor-
vinus (Contr. 13, 173 Exc. Contr. 3. pr.
10, 14), and appears also to mention the
grandfather (Contr. 10. pr. 11). F urther
particulars are here collected by Nipp.

1. neque meliorem, etc. Suetonius
(Cal. 10) gives almost the same words.

3. Servio Galba tum consule: see
on c. 15, 1. The story of this prediction
is given with considerable variations of
circumstance. Josephus (Ant. 18. 6, 9)
makes it a remark by Tiberius to his
friends on seeing Galba come in to him3
Dio relates it under the year 773, Α. D. 20
(57. 19, 4), as addressed to Galba on his
betrothal ; Suetonius (Galb. 4) makes it a
1predgction by Augustus in Galba's boy-

00 .

5. Graecis verbis. The words are
given, with some variation, by Suet. and
Dio l. l. .

6. (qugndoque : cp. 1. 4, 5. This word
indicates a distant, as ‘d tabis’ a short
time of rule. Dio and Suetonius explain
the equanimity of Tiberius by his know-
ledge that the event was distant.

7. Chaldaeorum: see on 2. 27, 2.

8. Thrasullum. Further particulam·
of him at Rhodes are given by Dio (55.
1 1, ι). He returned to Rome with Tibe-
rius (Suet. Aug. 98), lived constantly with
him (Dio, 57. 15, 7), and died a year
before him (Id. 58. ²7· 1). It is said that
he sometimes mitigated the cruelty of
Tiberius by deeeiving him (Suet. Tib. 6²).
He must be distinguished from his con-
temporary and namesake, the Alexandrian
rhetor and editor of Plato (see Grote,
Plato, i. p. 158) ; with whom the scholiast
on Juv. 6, 575 appears to confound him.

11. literarum ignarus: cp. 2. 54, 4;
one who could the less betray anything os
astrological craft.

12. avia. ac derupta: cp. 4. 45, 1.

16. isdem. rupibus, ‘by way of the
same rocks ; ’ cp. Introd. v. § ²5-

17. interrogatur an: cp. 11. 30, 23
31, 3, etc. ‘ An ’ is thus used with many
other verbs expressing inquiry or de·
liberation: see Gerber and Greef‚ Lex.
