CORNELII TA CITI ANNA LI ΠΜ [A. U.C. 768.

56. Igitur Germanicus quattuor legiones, quinque auxiliarium 1
milia et tumultuarias catervas Germanorum cis Rhenum co-

lentium Caecinae tradit,

totidem legiones, duplicem sociorum

L. Apronio ad munitiones viarum et fluminum relicto.

(rarum illi caelo) siccitate et amnibus modicis inoffensum iter
properaverat, imbresque et fluminum auctus regredienti metue-

bantur.

But the mention of Seg imerus seems out
os place, and he was probably now dead
(see 2. 10, ι); so that it seems better to
take the words as genit. sing, and explain
them. by supposing that ‘invisus’ and
‘inimici’ are to be distinguished; the
meaning being that Arminius, already at
enmity with Segestes on public grounds,
was additionally hatesul to him from the
way in which he became his son-in—Iaw.
This would be expanded in the next
sentence (⁶ quaeque . .erant',) where

‘apud infensos' answers to‘ inimici, ’and
‘incitamenta irarum’ to ‘invisus' The
correction of Nipp.‘ inimicus soceri’ is
tempting, both from the analogy of
‘invisus avunculo infensusque ’ (H. 4.- 70,
3), and from the likelihood os a loss of
the terminal ‘s,' owing to the initial of
the next word. The passages cited from
2. 45, 2, and 3. 16, 6, are hardly apposite.

1. Igitur3 this takes up the narrative
from ‘ praecepit' (c. 55, 1).

2. tumultuarias: cp. 15. 3, 3. Livy
osten uses the word of troops levied for
·ιιι emergency. Such are also called‘ su·
bitus miles’ (H. 4. 76, 2), and‘ subitan'i’

(Liv. 3. 4, ιι).

’ 3. Caecinae. The service for which
he was detached is shown below, where
the mention of the Marsi suggests that

’ his advance was in the same direction as

that of last year (c 50, 51).

totidem legiones. The four le-
gions of the upper army (cp. e. 37, 4) are
under the special command of Germani-
cus throughout this campaign; hence the'ir
legatus, Silius, is unmentioned. See c.
72, 1.

4. paterni praesidii. Taunus (cp
12. 28, 13 Mela 3. 3, 3ο) is clearly the
high tract, still preserving the name, ex-
tending, nearly parallel with the Main,
from the Rhine to the Nidda between
Wiesbaden and Homburg.
would therefore be that described ιιι Dio
(54 33, 4), as built by Drusus παρ’ αὐτῷ
τῷ Ρήνῳ.

5. rapit= ‘raptim ducit:' so 4. 25,²
etc.; Liv. 3. 23, 3; taken apparently from
Vergil (Aen 7, 725; ιο, 178; 308).

6. L. Apronio. This legatus, who
received· trium phalia' this year (c. 72,
1), appears fromp the Fasti (C. 1. L. 1. p.

548) to have been cos. suff. in 761, ΔΑ).
8. He is generally identified with the
Apronius who had served in Delmatia
(Vell. 2. 116, 2); and with the proconsul
ofAsricain 773, A D. 20 (3 αι, 1); prob-
ably also with the legatus of Lower Ger—-
manym 781 A.D. 28(4. 73, 1; 6. 30, 3).

7. rarum: cp. the similar parenthesis,
0 39 7·

inoffensum, ‘uninterrup ted‚’ poet·
ical, and in prose from L. pseneca: the
transitive ’ properare ’ is found in Sallust,
but is also chiefly poetical.

8. metuebantur. Lipsius has been
generally followed in this correction of
the MS. ‘metuebatur;‘ as ‘auctus’ is
probably plural, as well as ‘ imbres!

11. Adranam, the Eder, which takes
a north-easterly course, and, a little above
Cassel. joins the F ulda, itself a tributary
of the W eser.

14. pagis vicimum these words are
thus joined in G. 12, 3. The former is

used of some definite cantonal subdivision
