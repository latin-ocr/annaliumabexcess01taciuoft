10 INTRODUCTION.

To these evidences‚ that the ‘ Annals’ must have been written when
sources of informationnow lost to us were in existence, and are likely
to have been written before the date of Ptolemy‚ maybe added the
testimony of Jerome, that Tacitus did write, in thirty books, the
history of the whole period, or, as he expresses it, ‘the lives of the
Caesars,’ from the death of Augustus to that of Domitian²; an ar-
rangement of books answering to that of the second Medicean MS„
which itself purports to be transcribed from an original of the date ’
Α.1), 395, or contemporary with Jerome Β.

The much larger question of the internal evidence of style is here
necessarily omitted.

CHAPTER ΙΙΙ.

ΟΝ ΤΗΕ SOURCES OF INFORMATION OPEN TO TACITUS FOR
THIS PER10D3 AND THEIR PROBABLE VALUE.

1. WRITTEN narratives of the general history of the period or of parts
of it.

It is not the habit of Tacitus to name his informants; and in the
first six books he has done so twice only, citing the history of the
German wars by C. Plinius ³, and the memoirs of the younger Agrip-
pina, in each case for an incident relating to the elder Agrippina ⁴. It
is stated in the one case, and apparently implied in the other, that
he is taking from a less usual source something overlooked by those
whom he generally follows. In the later books we have references
to the general history of Pliny ⁵, to Cluvius Rufus ⁶, to Fabius Rusticus ⁷,
and to Domitius Corbulo ⁸.

General references are far more common ; and give evidence that·
there were many such works, and that his history was mainly drawn·
from them ⁹.

Of these many, a few names only can be now supplied. In extant
