48 INTRODUCTION.

donec . . . misceatur 2. 6, 53 donec . . . deterrerentur 1. 1, 4; oraret 1.
13, 73 dederetur 1. 32, 4, etc. Roby 1670, Dr. ξ. 169. For a complete
list of passages, see Gerber and Greef, Lex. s. v. The subjunct. is also
used to denote a fact, with quamvis, as 1. 68, 73 2. 38, 10 3 1 1. 20, 3, etc.;
as also very often in Suetonius and later writers. Dr. § 201.

V. Partz'cz’ples.

On the usage of the ablative absolute of participles, see ξ 31 ; 011 the
genitive with participles, ξ 33; and on the frequency of participial
clauses, § 81.

54. The frequent concise expressions by means of participles
are noteworthy.

(a) Aorz'slz'c present, as trucidantium . . . exturbantium 2. 2, 4; accu-
sante 6. 18, 2, etc.; hortante 6. 29, 73 cognoscens 12. 48, 1 ; and others.
A few instances are found in Sallust, Livy, Vergil: also in Greek, as
ἐπαγομένοις Thuc. 2. 2, 5 ς λαμβάνοντες ,Χθῐμ Hell. 2. 4, 25. Dr. ξ 207.

(b) Aorz‘stz'c perfect, not only, as in classical prose, of deponents‚ but
also of passive verbs, as occisis 1. 77, 13 missis 4. 55, 73 deusto 4.
64¹, 1; spoliatis 15. 45, 2 ; and others. Dr. § 209.

(c) In 3. 13, 2, convictum and defensum are used with the force of
condensed conditional clauses.

(d) The future partz'cz‘ffle is constantly used to express purpose, as inva-
surus 1. 36, 2 ; certaturus 1. 45, 3 3 adfuturus 2. 17, 1, etc. The dat. or abl.
absol. of this part. has still more distinctly the force of a condensed clause,
as tracturis 1. 31, 13 cessuris 1. 46, 3·; pugnaturis 2. 80, 4, ete. This
usage is not unfrequent in Livy and Plin. min. and abundant in Curtius.
Dr. § 208, Roby 1115, 3, Zumpt 639, note.

55. Partieiples are constantly used, for brevity, in place of
abstract verbal substantives or equivalent expressions, especially as
subject of a verb.

(a) Present, rarely, as Agrippina . . . tegens 4. 12, 2 ; Caesar . . . ac·
cipiens 4. 34, 2. Dr. § 210, 1.

(b) Perfeci, very frequently:

(1) Where an abstract noun followed by a genitive would
be expected3 as occisus Caesar 1. 8, 73 mutatus princeps 1. 16, ¹3
sama dediti Segestis . . . rapta uxor 1. 59, 1, 2 3 and very many others.

This usage is mostly confined to Livy and other historians‚ and espe-
cially common in Tacitus. Dr. ξ 210, 2, Madv. 426, Roby 1410.

., (2) In the neuter nominative, with or without a substantive,
