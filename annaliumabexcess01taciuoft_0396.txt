simul cetera illius aetatis memorabo, si effectis in quae tetendi =

μνηστευθεῖσα, κ.τ.λ). Vergil has ‘divae
Veneris nurus' (Aen. 2, 787).

2. itum in sententiam. That this
did not always imply unanimity, appears
here and in 14. ⁴9» 1.

3. Rubelli Blandi: see on 6. 27, 1.
According to Borghesi (see Henzen,1nscr.
p..4o6) he was cos. suff. with Annius
Pollio (cp. C. I. L. iv. 155 ι) during the
last six months of this year: see c. 51, 1.

aqua atque igni arcebatur. Al though
the confiscation of property usually in-
volved in such a sentence was here re-
mitted, the penalty was otherwise more
severe than that of the ‘lex Iulia de
adulteriis’ (see on 2. 50, 4), and equiva-
lent to that usually inflicted for ¹ maiestas '
(c. 50, 6). A similar severe sentence sor
adultery is noted in 4. 42, 3.

4. Scauro. As no other name is
mentioned, he must be the same spoken
of in 1. 13, 4, etc. He must have mar·
ried her aster her divoroe from Quirinius.

5. datum ne bona publicarentur.
This act would again show that Tiberius
s was ‘firmus adversum pecuniam,’ and
makes against the imputation of Sue-
tonius (Tib. 49), that he had procured
*the condemnation of Lepida to please
QuiriniuS, who was n‘ch and childless.

tum‘ demum, etc. It would appear
that the slaves of Quirinius had heen
examined privately by Tiberius; but only

those of Lepida at the public trial. It

does not necessarily follow that the evi· ἰ
dence of the latter had not already
established the charge of poisoning. Stahr κ
strangely here refers ‘eum ’ to Tiberius ’
himself, and draws inferences from it as
to his clemency. .
9. solacio adfecit. Nipp. notes that ,
‘ solari' or ‘consolari' osten take an ac- 1
cusative of that sor which consolation is ᾖ]
given, as in 2. 36, 3; 16. 13, 63 also in ’
Cie., as ‘ consolatur honestas egestatem* ᾗ

12. filiae ac neptis, the two ‘Iuliaez' -
see on 1. 53,1; 4. 71, 6. By ‘morte’he .

to Silanus. ,
