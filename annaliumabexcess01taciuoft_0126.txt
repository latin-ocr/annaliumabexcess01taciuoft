108 INTRODUCTION.

old recruiting grounds of the Republic ¹. The rest os Italy, so·⁴ far as its
scanty free population admitted it, might help to keep up the legions and
other cohorts of citizens, but of all these the main supply was now drawn
from the civic population throughout the empire ². Voluntary enlistment
seems usual, but ‘delectus' in the provinces preferable³; and enlist-
ment was no doubt kept down to a minimum by withholding the
‘ missio ⁴.¹

On the pay and grievances of the legionary soldier it is sufficient to
refer to the narrative of the mutiny⁵, and the, contrast there drawn be-
tween themselves and the praetorians; while a more favourable estimate
of their privileges, at a somewhat later date, can be formed from the six-
teenth Satire of Juvena13 and some information as to the rewards on
retirement, chiefly the gift of ⁴ civitas ' to auxiliaries, and the ratification
of marriages generally, can be gathered from the various ‘diplomata ⁸.’
To those of higher rank, many further advantages were attainable.
Centurions, besides being promoted to such posts as the command of
auxiliary cohorts or squadrons ⁷, or the rank of ‘praefecti castrorum ζ’
had regular pensions on retirement ⁹, and the ‘ primipili’ appear to have
retained even for life the title of ‘ primipilares¹⁰,' and to have been

appointed to responsible posts in the army, or as subordinate governors
of provincial districts ¹¹.

The fleets of Misenum and Ravenna ¹² are each dignified with the title
⁴ classis praetoria ¹³‚' but otherwise rank below not only the household
troops but the legions. The admiral, ‘praefectus ¹⁴‚’ ranks below the
‘praefectus praetorii ¹⁵,’ and is, at first, a knight3 or, later, sometimes
a freedman ¹⁶. The marine soldiers, ‘ classiarii,’ are not Roman citizens,
and, though of more consideration than the rowers ²⁷, are so far on a par
