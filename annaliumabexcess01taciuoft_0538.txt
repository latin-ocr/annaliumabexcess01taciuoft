Neapolis in exchange the more important
island Aenaria (Ischia)‚ and had taken
a fancy to it and erected a villa, where
he spent some days shortly before his
death (Suet. 98). For further account of
its topography, see Mr. Bunbury (in Dict.
of Geog.), and a description in Bentley's
Misc. vol. xxxiv. (1853). p. 588, foll.

2. inportuosum . . . mare, apparently
from Sall. Jug. 17, 5; used also of ‘li-
tora' (Liv. 10. 2, 4), ‘litus ’ (Pl. Epp. 6.
31, 17), ‘insula' (Pl. N. H. 4. 12, 23, 73).

3. subsidia, ‘ places of refuge ε ’ cp. 2.
63, Ῑ; 3. 36, 23 60, 2, etc. Two small
eoves exist on the north and south, on
either side of the modern town of Capri,
which lies in the depression between the
eastern and western precipices. The
southern, or ‘ piccola marina,’ shows
traces of having been the ancient port.

adpulerit, potential subjunctive.

“ nisi gnaro custode, ‘without know-

ledge of the sentinel.’ The point of out-

look would probably be on the eastern

precipice‚ sacing the mainland, where the

remains of the Pharos, mentioned by

,⁶ Suet. (Tib. 74) and Statius (Silv. 4. 5,
= 100), still exist.

4. obiectu montis: cp. ‘obiectu la-
terum ’ (Verg. Aen. 1, 160). The moun·
tains in the island can hardly be said to
shelter it, and their principal elevation is
at the west; so that the mainland range
terminating in the promontory of Minerva
appears to be meant, which keeps off the
wind in the most inclement quarters.

5. aestas in favonium obversa, etc.
The meaning is clear, but the expression
ο harsh from its brevity: ‘its summer cli·
mate, as it faces the west and has open
sea around, is lovely.’ Favonius denotes
the westerly wind beginning to blow
early in February (Plin. H. N. 2. 47, 119,
122, ,etc.). The high position of Ana
Capri, towering above the depression in
which the town lies, occupies the western
gortion, with the highest point (Monte

olar) immediately above it.

66. pei-amoena, ἄπ. εἶμι see Introd. v. ,ξ
p9u10herrimum sinum: cp. ‘beatos
Campaniae sinus' H. 3. 66, 3. ΤΙιε dis-
trict round Vesuvius was renowned before ,,
the eruption for fertility as well as beauty: η
cp. Verg. G. 2, ²²4 ‘talem dives arat ’
Capua et vicina Vesevo ora iugo? Strabo, ’
however (5. 4, 8, 247), noticed traces of η
its former volcanic action. 1
antequam Vesuvius . . . verteret.
‘before the fires of Vesuvius began to
ruin the landscape.‘ Mr. Dallin rightly ,¹
{3332 12⁰{03332a‘h5012332 αἶὲἳῗζίηὲῗ
the great eruption of 832, ΑΛ). 79. Such .
is distinctly attested by Statius (Sylv. 4.
4, 80) ‘aemula Trinacriis volvens in· ζ
cendia flammis,’ and (85) ‘nepdum letale '
minari cessat apex ; ’ though no great τ
eruption is again recorded ti119oo‚ Ad). »
203 (Dio, 76. 2, 1). ·’
7. Graecos ea tonuisse. ‘that Greeks .
had possessed those spots:’ cp. ‘Evan-
drum qui . . . tenuerit looe’ Liv. 1. 5, ι, ²
‘tenuisse . . . Lirim' Hor. Od. 3. 17. 8. ;
