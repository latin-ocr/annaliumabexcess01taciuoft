1. abducta, etc. Some such verb as
‘memorabatur’ has to be supplied from
the negative clause. On the marriage
of Livia, see 5. 1, 3. The answer of the
pontiffs to this ‘ mockery of consultation'
is given by Dio, 48. 44, 2.

2. Q.. †¹1'edji. The MS. has ‘nube-
retque tedii et uedii.' The choice is be-
tween a name otherwise unknown, and a

· variety of conjectures, as ⁶ Q. Pedii·
(Wolf, from Suet. Jul. 83, etc.), ‘ C. Ma-
tii’ (Freinsh., from 12. 60, 6), neither of
whom are expressly noted for luxury ; or

num’ =⁴quales numinum esse solent,'
‘statues with divine attributes: as the
thunderbolt‚ etc.

6. vellet, used invidiously of mere
permission. According to Suet. Aug. 52,
and Dio, 51. 20, 7, temples to Augustus
in his lisetime were allowed by him only
in the provinces, and only in association
with the worship of Roma (see on c. 78,
1). 1t is indeed plain from inscriptions,
that at least a local or private worship
and local ⁶ flamines ’ of Augustus existed
during his lifetime in various Italian

⁸Q. Alledii’ (Roth, from Juv. 5, 118).
Nipp. reads ‘quae edito’ (sc. ‘ partu rite
nuberet ’)‚ on the supposition that a
general question in such terms was laid
before the pontifis, not a particular case.

3. Vedii Pollionis, a knight of low
birth and vast wealth (cp. Dio, 54. 2 3, 1),
noted for throwing live slaves to his
lampreys‚ even in presence of Augustus
(Pl. N. H.9.23, 39, 773 Sen. deIra,3.40);
who showed his indignation at the time,
and on inheriting his villa at Pausilipum
destroyed it forits associations (Ovi Fast-
6, 639, ete). It is treated as a reflection
on him, that such a man was ever his
friend.

gravis. She is ‘gravis mater‚' as
having forced her son into the successiom
‘noverca.‘ as having, in popular belief,
caused the deaths of his competitors,
Gaius and Lucius; see c. 3, 3, etc. ‘ In
rem publicam’ may be taken as in c. 8,
f 7, or as in c. 76, 5. Cp. Cic. Balb. 9,
²4 ⁸ est in populum Romanum grave.'

ne Tiberium, etc. Even Suetonius
rejects this imputation (Tib. 21); nor
does Tacitus elsewhere think it neces·
sary to refer to any other cause than the
influence of Livia (4. 57, 5).

8. deterrima, i. e. ‘ cum deterrimo
homine,' an inexact expression due to
desire of brevity. Nipp.

9. paucis ante annis, i. e. at the
date of the last renewal. His second
tenure of this power, dating probably
from July 1, 757, ΑΛ). 4 (see Introd. viii.
p. 114), is supposed by Dio (55. 13. 2)
to have been sor ten years, and a renewal
is dated in 766, Α.1). 13 (56. 28, 1); but
probably Suetonius is right in stating the
term as five years (Tib. 16), whereby the
renewal would sall in 762, Α.1). 9. As it
had evidently not expired at the death of
Augustus (see c. 7, 5), the last renewal
was probably for lise.
