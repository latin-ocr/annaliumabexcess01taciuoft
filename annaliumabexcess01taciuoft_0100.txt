nor has he throne or diadem, but the familiar curule chair, ‘the laurel- ’

wreath and lictors. His household troops keep the old title of ‘ cohors
praetoria! Nor is Dio right in representing him as ⁴ legibus solutus¹ 3’
his special exemption from some laws ² implying that he is bound by all
others. Again, his family have no dignities except by special decree.
Livia, the type in early times of exceptional female privilege, received
tribunitian sanctity, and was made ‘ sui iuris ‘ in her husband’s lifetime⁸z
her honours at his death were strictly limited⁴; her deification at the
time of her death refused⁶; her political influence was only personal:

not till after Domitian does ‘ Augusta' become a regular titles: only

Agrippina seems formally to share the power of husband or son, and to ’

be in very deed an ‘ empress : ' the association of the sisters of Gaius in
the oath⁷ seems a mere freak of power: sons of the ruling house are
no more than, and are not always, ‘ principes iuventutis ⁸ ’ in youth; and
are afterwards enabled only by special decree⁹ to forestall the lawful age for
magistracies: the households of Caesar are at first no greater than those
of other eminent citizens ¹⁰ ς his secretaries, accountants‚ etc.‚ no higher
than freedmen.

Nor could the princeps formally name a successor; much as he could ι

“ do indirectly to gulde the choice of one. The person left heir in his will

had a position of vantage by 'succeeding to the ‘ fiscus‚' in which public
money was mingled with the ‘ res privata principis ε’ yet neither Livia ¹¹
nor Tiberius Gemellus ¹² acquired by heirship any share of empire. An
act of adoption by the princeps is figuratively called by Tacitus ‘ comitia
imperii 13 ; ' but such adoption was not limited to one ¹⁴, and hardly receives
its full significance till the adoption of Trajan. Similarly the title of
‘ princeps iuventutis,’ though sometimes taken to mark out a successor ¹⁵,
might be shared by more than one 1⁶, and was usually dropped at man-
hood. Far rnore influence would be exerted by the association of an in-
tended heir in the ‘proconsulare imperium,’ or ‘tribunitia potestas: or, as
was the case with Tiberius, in both ¹⁷. But this step was rarely taken, and
