found, (1) for the news of the death of
Augustus to reach Pannonia, (2) for the
mutiny to develop itself‚ and for news of
it to reach Rome, (3) for the march os
Drusus and a considerable force from
Rome to the spot. For many other such
evidences, see Friedlander, ii. p. 18, etc.
Dio. (57. 3, 1) may be right in saying
that Tiberius had already suspicions of
this and the German army, when he hesi-
tated to accept the principate; but the
mutiny can hardly have been already
known to have broken out, as Suet. (Tib.
25) states.

Pannonicas. Pannonia was among
the most important Caesan‘an provinces,
its' ‘legatus’ being always of consular
rank (see Introd. vii. p. 16). It extended
along the Danube from Vienna to
Belgrade; in other directions its limits
are at this time not clearly marked, most
os Illyricum being placed under its ‘le-
gatus,' and that name sometimes inter-
changed with it (e. g. c. 46, 1); though
the maritime part of Illyricum, the ‘ Del-
matia' of 4. 5, 5, was at this time sepa-
rately governed by P. Dolabella (Vell. 2.
125, 5). See Marquardt, Staatsv. i. p.
138, 144.

1. nullis novis causis: this is best
taken as abl. abs.

3. tres simul legiones, These are

' winter quarters of each legion were

usually separate (see 2. 57, 2, ete), or
at most two were quartered together (e.

(⁶geminari legionum castra prohibuit'
Suet. Dom. 7).

4. Iunio Blaeso. Inscripfions, cited

by Nipp., show that Blaesus had been
proconsul of Sicily after his praetorship,
and consul suffectus in 763, Α. D. 10.
Asterwards we hear of him as having for
his nephew Seianus, through whose in·
fluence he became ‘extra sortem' pro·
consul of Africa, and gained the ‘tri-
umphalia' and the title of ‘imperator'

(3· 35, ²5 72‚6; 74, 6); and at whose —

fall he perished (see 5. 7, 2).

5. aut gaudium. N ipp. brackets these
words as an insertion 3 but it is certainly
in the manner of Tacitus to add such an
alternative clause, answering to ‘initiis
Tiberiiz' though the ‘iustitium' is suf-
ficient reason by itself for suspension of
military activity‚ and is referred to as
such in the case of the German army
(c. 50, 1). '

8. dux . . . theatralium operarum
There seems to be no reason why any per·
sons employed in theatres as scene-shisters.
stage-carpentem, etc„ should not be call·
ed ‘theatrales operae ;’ but from the
mention here of a body organized under
a ‘dux‚' and from the special acquirement
of Percennius (‘miscere coetus . . . doc-
tus'), it is generally inserted that the
‘operae' here spoken of were the pro-
fessional ‘elaqueurs‚' of whose existence
there is abundant evidence (see Fried-
lauder, ii. p. 430; Marquardt, Staatsv.
iii. p. 520), and whose ‘fuglemen' are

styled ‘duces' (Suet. Ner. 20), or ‘sig- '⁶

niferi‘ (Id. 26), or ‘capita factionum'
(Id. Tib. 37). Such service in applaud-

ing is itself spoken of as ‘theatralis s

opera’ in Plin. Epp. 7. 24, 7, and is here

called ‘histrionale studium ;' an expres·
sion apparently equivalent to the ‘histri·
onalis favor’ of Dial. 29. 3. which cer· .‘

tainly means ⁶ favor erga histriones?
