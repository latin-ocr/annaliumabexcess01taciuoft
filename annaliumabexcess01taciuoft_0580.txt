parenthetical and abbreviated insertion of
this clause, instead of a full expression of
it in its proper place. N ipp. compares the
use of ‘neque ita multo post' in Cic.

now the chief occasions on which popular
demands or other grievances found ex-

fifth century writes (Ep. 1. 10) ‘vereor,

another such dearth, Claudius was mob-
bediu the forum (12. 43, 2).

3. quanto maiorem, etc. Augustus
is said (Aur. Vict. Epit. 1, 6) to have' 1m-
ported twenty million ‘modii’ annually
from E t alone. Tiberius reckons the

‘in,’ see note on 1.14, 3.

8. Geminius, celsus, Pompeius.
Here, as in 2. 4³8, 1, the mention of Ro-
man knights by one name has led some
to think that praenomina have dropped

out. These persons are unknown, for the
Ῥοῦφος Γεμίνιος of Dio, 58. 4, 5, is now ξ
taken to be Fufius Geminus. ³

him from the Celsus just above3 and the ἱ
recent specification of his tribunate (l. 1.) ·
enables it to be here left undescribed. ¹

It is implied that this Rubrius was ι “·;
