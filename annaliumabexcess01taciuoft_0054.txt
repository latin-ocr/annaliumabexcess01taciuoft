15. 'I'he dative of indirect object, with implied local relation
(literal or figurative), where the abl. with prep. would be more usual
(Roby 1144), is adopted chiefly from poets and Livy. Among verbs
with which it is used are abstrahere 2. 5, 1, etc.; excusari 1. 12, 3, etc.;
eximere 1. 48, 2, etc.; extrahere 6. 23, 5; proripere 4. 45, 4. Dr. (ξ 46)
refers other instances to this head (see 4. 72, 2 ; 13. 42, 4).

16. 'I'he Greek attracted dative (βουλομένοις ἦν), elsewhere restricted
in Latin to volenti and volentibus, is extended to invitis aut cupientibus
erat 1. 59, 1. Dr. ξ 48. The ordinary usage whereby, in expressions such
as cui nomen est, the name itself is attracted to the case of the pronoun,
is restricted by Tacitus to adjectives (as 1. 31, 2 3 2. 8, 1, ete.): the nomi-
native (as 1. 45, 1, etc.)‚ or, rarely, the genitive (see note on 4. 59,
2), being used of substantives. (Nipp. on 2. 16.) Cp. Madv. 246, obs.

1'7. 'I'he ‘dativus commodi’ is extended to such usages as sibi

. . . procubuisse 1. 59, 43 sibi. ..firmabat 1. 71, 53 ut mihi informis, sic
tibi magnifica 12. 37, 2 ; even non referre dedecori 15. 65, 2. Dr.

18. 'I'he dative of the agent is used, without restrictiori to the gerun-
dive or to passive participles or adjectives in ‘·bilis’ (Roby 1146), and
without any notion of the interest of the agent (Madv. 250 a), in more
than thirty places, e. g. sibi . . . adspici 1. 17, 10; propinquis. . . removeretur
2. 50, 4. Cp. 2. 57, 5; 3. 3, 3; 20, 3, etc. It is not easy always to
distinguish this dative from such ablatives as are noted in§ 27. Dr. ξ 51, -
Nipp. on 2. 50.

19. 'Phe dative of a noun so closely connected with another-that
a genitive would be expected (Roby 1154), frequent in poets‚ is 'also ὲ
frequent in Livy, and still more in Tacitus3 e. g. rector iuveni 1. 24, 3; 3³
paci firmator 2. 46, 63 and very many others. Dr. ξ 53. ’ξ
20. 'l'he dative of the thing as object, often used with adjectives or ὲ
participles, as promptus 1. 2, 1, etc. ; intentus 1. 31, 23 facilis 2. 27, 2, ²
“etc.; appears to be an extension of the usage with persons. Madv. ’
