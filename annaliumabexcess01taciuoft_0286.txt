CORNELII TACITI ANNALIUM [A.U.C. 769.

modicam praedam et Arpi principis Chattorum coniugem filiam-

famam adventus eius dilapsi.

8. Iamque classis advenerat, cum praemisso commeatu etl

distributis in legiones ac socios navibus fossam, cui Drusianae
nomen, ingressus precatusque Drusum patrem ut se eadem au·
sum libens placatusque exemplo ac memoria consiliorum atque
operum iuvaret, lacus inde et Oceanum usque ad Amisiam flu-

men secunda navigatione pervehitur.

12 castellum. Nipp. notes that, had
Tacitus meant ‘Aliso,' he would have
given the name here instead of below.
That fort would be the one described by
Dio (54. 33, 4) as built at the junction of
the Λουπίας καὶ Ελίσων (Lipp e and Ahse)‚
westward of Hamm; this one would be
further east, probably near Lippborg,
certainly, from the context, near the
Teutoburger- W ald.

5. nuper. see Ι. 62, 1.

6. sitam. The use of this word 1n the
sense of‘ conditus’ (asin 3. 38, 6; 4. 55,
63 6. 41, 2, etc.) is peculiar to Tacitus.
Draga, connecting it with a particular
use of‘ sistere' (see 4. 37, 4), appears to
take it as a form of passive participle of
that verb. But the use noted on 1. 39,
4 connects this with the ordinary senses of
the participle of‘ sino? ‘'Druso must
be dat. commod. answering to‘ legionibus.
Such an altar may have been merely
commemorative (see on 1. 14, 3), or may
have been set up for the private worship
of his¹ Di Manes’ (.cp c. 83, 3), possibly
at the place of his death.

8. decucurrit. The ‘decursio sune-
bris’ is alluded to 111 Verg g. Aen. 11, 188;
Luc. 8, 7353 and described with more
detail in Stat. Theb. 6, 213, etc. The
custom is described as observed even by
the army of Hannibal (Liv. 25. 17, 5), and
corresponds to the procession of chariots
round the dead Patroclus (Il. 2 3, 13).

haud visum. Probably he did not

actually reach the spot.

9. limitibus aggeribusque: for the
former, see note on 1. 50, 23 for the latter
on 1. 62, 2.

12. distributisin: cp. 1.55‚ 2; c. 67,
43 3· 38, 42 etc· .

Drusianae: see Suet. Cl. 1. This
work included both the construction of
the ‘Neue Yssel,’ connecting the Rhine
near Arnheim with the old Yssel at Does·
burg, and a widening of the latter river
to its mouth.

13. eadem ausum. Drusus was in 742,
B.c. 12 (Dio, 54. 32, 2), the first Roman
to sail on the northern ooean. Suet. Cl. 1:
cp. Strab. 7. 1, 3, 290. The same route

et cuncta inter cas· 5

classis Amisiae ore relicta 2

was taken in the previous year by a part “
of the army (1. 60, 3), and afterwards by »ς

Corbulo (11.18, 2).
16. classis Amisiae ore, etc. Nipp.
and Halm follow Seyffert* 111 inserting ore,’

which could easily have been lost before γ
‘relictas Tacitus would not have called .

the river ⁶ amnis Amisiae‚' but ‘ amnis (or
‘flumen') Amisia’(cp. c. 23, 1; 1. 32, 3,
etc.:) and, though there appears to have
existed a place gcalled Ἀμάσεια (Ptol. 2.
11, 28), or Ἀμισσα 818ρ11.Β)2.); he
would hardly have spoken of it without
removing ambiguity by adding‘ oppido!
In the next line, the addition os ‘’aut
(W urm, Ritter, Halm) would make the
criticism assert that Germanicus ought
either to have sailed his fleet up the river

(cp. ‘subvehebatur' c. 60, 1) to a part ”
