Agricola ¹. The fulness of detail found in the description of all the
actions of Germanicus, and even of the progress of his remains to
Rome, and of the proceedings after his death, appears to suggest the
existence of some such special source of information ς the more so
as he is known to have been accompanied in Germany by Pedo Albi-
novanu52, and at the time of his death by another man of letters,
Vibius Marsus ³.

It was perhaps from such biographies that Tacitus enriche'd his
record of the scenes of the last years of Tiberius with cases unknown
to or unnoticed by his usual authorities ⁴.

Collections-of letters, similar to those of the younger Pliny, may
also have been made by public men; and the distinguished orators
of the period, such as Q. Haterius ⁵, L. Arruntius ⁶, Domitius Afer',
and others, were probably in the habit of revising and publishing their
speeehes⁸. The speech of P. Vitellius at the trial of Cn. Piso· is
referred to by the elder Pliny ¹⁰.

2. ‘Acta senatus,’ also called ‘acta patrum ¹¹,' or ‘commentarii
senatus ¹²? The composition, or at least the publication of a record
of proceedings in the Senate was instituted by Julius Caesar in his
first consulship ¹³. 'Augustus is said to have suppressed the publication
of this Journal ¹⁴. By the time of Tiberius the senator superintending
the ‘acta’ was appointed by the princeps ¹¹⁵, which suggests the pos·
sibility of garbling the record. Some account of proceedings in the
senate appears still to have been made public in the ‘acta populi ¹⁶ ;'

< and the archives of the Senate themselves would presumably have been
open to a senator. Though Tacitus refers to* them at a later date ¹¹⁸, it
has been thought that sor the earlier period he was for some reason
’ unable to consult them ¹⁸. It is certainly remarkable, that in places
where we should most expect a reference to them, other authorities
are cited ¹⁹. We have on the other hand references to extant speeches
or letters addressed by the princeps to the senate ²⁰, which might more
