CORNELII TA CI TI ANNA LI UM [Α. U.C. 765.

iam iamque iturus legit comites, conquisivit impedimenta, ador-
navit naves: mox hiemem aut negotia varie causatus primo
prudentes, dein vulgum, diutissime provincias fefellit.

48. At Germanicus, quamquam contracto exercitu et parata l
5 in defectores ultione, dandum adhuc spatium ratus, si recenti
exemplo sibi ipsi consulerent, praemittit literas ad Caecinam,
venire se valida manu ac, ni supplicium in malos praesumant,

usurum promisca caede.

et quod maxime castrorum sincerum erat occulte recitat, utque
10 cunctos infamiae, se ipsos morti eximant hortatur: nam in pace
causas et merita spectari: ubi bellurn ingruat, innocentes ac

noxios iuxta cadere.

construction of a participle with ὧς is
very rare, and not found with the future
participle. Tacitus has ‘ ut . . . arguens ’
(4. 33, 6); ‘ut . . . transmissurus’ (H. 2.
58, 4l; ‘ut . . . positurus' (H. 3. 68, 4).
See other instances in Introd. v. ξ 67.

1 . legit. . . conquisivit . . . adornavit.
On the fondness of Tacitus for asyndeta
in lively narrative, see Introd. v. ξ 65.
In such clauses he more frequently uses
the historical infinitive (as 2. 31, 1), or
ξ’ἑὲῗῗεὲἓῗιῆἴ· ιῗιέ ἰὶὲῑῖἓῗῃζιζῖ tii}
clause, but sometimes for variety at the
end in the last clause (as c. 68, 2 ; 2. 29,
1). Other examples are here collected by
Ni .

ΞΡ causatus, ‘pleadingz’ cp. 13. 44,
2, etc. ; freq. in poets and Livy.

3. vulgum. This accus„ found in
Lucr.‚ Verg., and Liv. is not unsre uent
in Tacitus: cp. 3. 76, 2; 4. 14, 4; . 44,
1 ; and several other references given by
Ni .

gp dandum . . . spatium. This is
ssflssssvaffinssi‘ifi efficffl‘ssssmrsss? {3¹1¹ ’ἐῖἷίἰῖὴ
design, or attempt, ‘si’ isp often usedpiii
the sense of ‘ whether,' or ‘in case that.‘
’ See Madv. 451 d. Dr'ager (Synt. und
Stil, ξ 193) notes the usage as found in
Cicero, and Caesar, and especially in
Livy, and that it is not really a Graecism.

6. exemplo, that of the two other
legions (c. 44).

Caecinam. He must have gone on

tunc signo inter se dato inrumpunt4.

to ‘ Vetera’ soon after leading the two
other legions to the ‘civitas Ubiorum'

(c. 37, 3), as he is not mentioned in the -

events there (c. 39-44).

7. praesumant: cp. 2. 73, 6; 3. 46,
2, etc. The word is confined to poets
and post-Augustan prose.

8. promisca. The first Medicean MS.
has always this form (cp. 3. 34. 33 53, 53
70, 23 4. 16, 5; 37, 5); whereas the
second interchanges it with ¹ promiscuus ’
(cp. e. g. 14. 14, 3 and 15. 9, 2). ‚Halm
throughout adopts the formem Baiter and
others follow the MS. On such variations,
see Introd. v. 5 85, Pfitzner, p. 4².

aquiliferis signiferisque. On the
former cp. c. 39, 7: ⁴ signiferi legionum ’
are often mentioned in inscriptions-
Orelli (on Inscr. 348²) supposes them to
be ‘ signiferi cohortium' (see on c. 18. 3);
Ritter, to be the bearers of the ‘ vexilla'
or ‘signa’ of maniples, for whom no
special title appears to occur in inscrip-
tions. Caecina appears to be obliged to
act through these officers, as there weoe
no centurions left. See c. 32, 3.

10. eximant. The dative with this
verb, frequent in poets and post-Augustali
prose, is generally used by Tacitus (cp.
c. 64, 4; 2. 55, 3; 3. 18, 1, eto). except
in Agr. 3, ¹amand perhaps in 14. 64, 1.

11. eausa-s, ⁸ excuses : ' so ⁶ causam
seditioni’ (H. 4. 19, ι), ‘ accipio causam'
(Cic. Fam. 16. 19).

15. promptum. On the dative with
this word, see c. 2, 1.
