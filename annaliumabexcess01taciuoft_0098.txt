80 INTRODUCTION.

two¹ out of twenty ², in the praetorship four out of twelve³; with some
unknown proportion of tribunes and aediles ⁴.

(2) The presiding magistrate at the old comitia could always resuse to
receive the name of, and reject votes tendered for, an unqualified candi-
date ⁶. Out of this grew a right, claimed by Caesar as chief magistrate,
to ‘nominate' candidates, as well as to ‘commend⁶ .' Such ‘nominatio,'
made by publishing a list of candidates, implied no more than that they
were qualified to receive votes, and might contain any number of names;
but it was the interest, and probably a common practice, of the princeps,
to name no more nor fewer candidates than there were vacancies ⁷ ς and
v thus to reduce the whole election to a sham3 for, though the presiding
consul had probably power to publish a supplementary list ⁸, those
‘nominated' by Caesar would be sure of preference. In the choice of
consuls this mode of influence seems to have been adopted. There is
no trace of formal ² commendatio,' or of special ‘ candidati Caesaris' sor
this office, but care seems to have been taken to control the elections
informally ⁹.

Again, candidates for the quaestorship, which gave admission to the Ξ

senate, must have been ‘tribuni militum‚’ or have served on the ‘ viginti-
viratus ¹⁰‚’ and had usually filled both positions. Of these qualifications,
the first, as a military rank, could clearly be only obtained with consent
of Caesar ¹¹.

Besides those entering the senate through magistracy, others are men·
tioned in inscriptions, as early as the time of Claudius, as ‘adlecti a
principe ¹²,' and names were probably then added at the ‘lectiones sena-
tus' held by Augustus ¹³. Such ‘adlecti' have usually a rank assigned
as if they had been qualified by office ¹⁴. The power of expulsion of
senators and annual revision of the list has been already mentioned, as
well as the constant control of that body by the rights of ‘ relation ’ and
