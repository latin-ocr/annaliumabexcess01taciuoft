Dio, 58. 9 3 on his suicide in 791, A.D.

2. large, ‘in comprehensive terms,' i.e.
ῧὶιῗὲρῗξζὲἓεεῗὲ {3222055332ffl1‘3’122222
18, 6) adds that it was also decreed that
the senators should themselves be searched
for hidden arms.

4. adeo numquam: cp. ‘adeo non'
3· 43, 3-

d'eviis . . . itiner-ihm, etc. This
may probably answer to the second (cp.
c. Ι, 2) of the two occasions on which
Suetonius (Tib. 72) speaks of him as ap-
proaching Rome (‘ iterum Appia usque
ad septimum lapidem ¹). Dio (58. 21, 1)
shortens the distance to thirty stadia.
We should gather from Tacitus (cp. c.
39, 2) that he approached Rome more
frequently.

5. ambiens: so most modern editors,
aster Rhenanus, for the MS. ‘ambigens‚'
which can hardly be explained either as
‘ambagibus circumiens' (Em), or περι-
άγων (Walth.), or like ‘ambiguus an
intraret‚’ in c. 1, 1 (Pfitzner). ‘Ambio’
its used in this sense by Cic„ Ov.‚ and

uc.

declinans, probably transitive, as
in c. 51, 33 H. 3. 84, 5,etc.; but it might
be intrans„ as in 14. 56, 2.

6. ineos inrupit: see note on 2. 11, 4.

7. auctitabant. This may be called
«In. dp„ though the verb is found in a
different sense in a late writer.

legem dictatoris-<caesaria By an
ordinance passed by Caesar as dictator in
704 or 705, nc. 49 or 48 (Caes. B. C. 3.
1, ²3 Suet. Caes. 42), the interest paid
or in arrem- was struck off from the

rincipal, and creditors had to take in
ieu of payment the real and personal

This appears to be a temporat-y measure:
and hence Nipp. is probably right in
thinking that the permanent law os the
dictator, ‘ de modo credendi possidendique
intra Italiam‚' is not definitely known to
us. This, he thinks, may possibly have
been the law which Matius had sup-
ported, though a loser by it (Cic. ad
Fam. ii. 27, 7; 28, 2): possibly also that

which Dio (41. 38, 1) notices at that date s

as an old law revived‚ limiting to 60,000
H.S. the amount of coinage which any

capitalist might possess in store, may

have formed part of it. It may also be Α
gathered that the law aimed at forcing Α

all capitalists to become, to some ex—

tent, Italian landowners; not 'only with ξ
a view to encourage the expenditure of Ἴ
capital on the better tillage of the soil, ³
but also, as intended by analogous enact- ἢ

pp. 523, foll. Possibly Horace, writing i
when the law was falling into abeyance, ε
may have humorously glanced at its

futility in his picture of the usurer turning ς
sarmer (Epod. 2, 67). It would also be

evideut from Cicero (Att. 5. 21, 11, etc.)‚ .
that ‘ centesimae usurae‘ (1 per cent. per ,,
month, or 12 per cent. per annum) was ηε
in his time legal interest. and from Horace ¹
(Sat. 1. 2, 14), that five times that amount “.

was sometimes exacted; but such ntes
may be taken (see Momms. Rom. Hist.
b. ii. c. 3, p. 311) as corresponding to
about half that amount in modern value.
