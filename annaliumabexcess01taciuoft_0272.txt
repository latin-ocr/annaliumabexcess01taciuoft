at first by lot, afterwards by selection;
and, as funds fell short, received other
taxes. as the ‘vicesima hereditatum¹ (Dio,
55. 2 5, 5); some eonfiscated property, as

:that of Agrippa Postumus (Dio, 55. 32,

2) ; and some foreign revenues (2. 42, 6).
Probably a deficiency in its funds caused
the subsytitution of land gifts for money,
complained os by the veterans (e. 17, 5).

1. simul,⁴ even with its help?

nisi vicensimo, i. e. unless the con—
cession lowering the time of their‘ mis-
sio' from the twentieth to the sixteenth
year of service (see c. 36, 4) were revoked.
As the discharge then given after sixteen
yeam, was only ‘missio sub vexillo,’ it
would here seem that some gratuity was
payable at that stage. The praemium
given by Augustus on full discharge was
12,0oo H. S. to the legions (Dio, 25. 23,
1); but Tiberius is said to have avoided
‘missiones' as much as possible (Suet.
Tib. 48); and Gaius to have reduced the
gratuity by one half (Suet. Cal. 44).

3. sedecim stipendiorum finem.
Nipp. follows Walther in explaining this
as a genitive of quality.

municipiorum et coloniarum. These
terms are constantly used together by
Tacitus (cp 3 55 4; 4 67 ῐ; 15 33,

taken to include both Roman and Latin
colonies. The old distinction between
‘ mimicipia‘ and ‘coloniae’ (see Watson,
Select Letters of Cicero, Appendix xii)
had become obsolete, and Tacitus ap-
pears, below' m this chapter, and perhaps
in 3. 2, 2. to use ‘coloniae' as a common
term for both; but to attain colonial rank
was still an honour to an Italian town
(14. 27, 2). Of the towns here mention·
ed, Florentia alone was a colony, and
that from recent date.

8. ne Clanis, etc. The marshes near
Cortona and Arretium are the souroe of
the Chiana (Clanis). and also of streams
flowing north into the Arno.

9. idque . . . adferret. On ‘idque.'
see note on c. 77, 5. ‘Adferret‘ is used
as ‘traheret' (2. 58, 1), ‘maneret' (2. 81,
35, ⁴ exstrueret' (4. 37, 1), etc.; in allos
which cases a request that something
may or may not happen, is addressed to
those with whom it rests to permit or
hinder it See Nipp. on 2. 58.

the Nar (Nera).

Reatini. Of Reate (Rieti) in Sabina.
Between this place and Interamna, the
lake and river Velinus are discharged
into the Nar through the passage cut
by Μ’. Curius (Cic. Att. 4. 15, 5), forming
the famous F alls of Terni. The expres-
sions here used seem to show that it had -
come to be regarded as a work of nature. “ ¹
