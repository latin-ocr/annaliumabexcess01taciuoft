10 86. Post quae rettulit Caesar capiendam virginem in locum1

1. ultionem legis, ‘ enforcement of the
legal penalty,’ i. e. that of ‘lex Iulia de
adulteriis' (cp. c. 50, 2). By this law he
was bound at once (under penalty of
being charged with connivance) to
separate from his wife (Dig. 48, 5, 2, 5 6);
and having done so, had during the next
sixty days exclusive right of proceeding
against her (Id. 11, ς 6). Nipp. adds that
he was not usually liable to be called to
account for not having exercised this
prerogative‚ even aster the sixty days had
expired, but that this whole case was re-
garded as exceptionally flagrant.

2. necdum = ⁴ nondum,’ a post-Aug.
use; as in H. 1. 31, 53 Plin. Pan. 14.

satis visum, repeated from H. 4. 59,
2; Liv. 7. 11, 9, etc.

de Vistilia statuere, ‘to deal with
Vistilia ε ’ cp. 6. 29, 23 12. 54, 6, etc.

3. in insulam Seriphon. Such rele-
gation was part of the penalty of the ‘lex
1u1ia ' (see on c. 50, 4). This island, one
of the Cyclades, now Serpho, was the
place of exile os Cassius Severus (4. 2 1, 5);
and, like Gyaros, is looked upon by
Jilivenal (10, 170) as typical of such
p aces.

4. de saeris Aegyptiis Iudaicisque
pellendis. Tacitus dismisses ¹briefly a
subject of small interest to himself and
his readerS, but Josephus (Ant. 18. 3, 4,
5) gives a full account of the circumstances
which appear to have led to these decrees.
A scandalous outrage had been committed
by a knight named Decius Mundus, on a
noble Roman lady named Paulina, in the
temple of Isis and with the connivance of
the priests3 and Tiberius had crucified the

priests, demolished the temple, and caused-

the statue of Isis to be thprown into the
Tiber. At the same time a vagabond
Jew, with three accomplices, had per-
suaded. a noble proselyte named Fulvia to
send costly gifts to the temple at Jerusa-

lem, which they had embezzled. On the
Isiac worship at Rome, introduced prob-
ably soon after the second Punic war,
prevalent in spite of many attempts to
suppress it, and reluctantly tolerated by
Augustus outside the pomoerium (Dio,
53. 2, 4), see Marquardt, Staatsv. iii.
p. 76, etc. The settlement os Jews at
Rome is supposed to have begun with the
conquest of Pompeius ; they were oer-
tainly numerous in Italy in the time of
Cicero (pro Flacc. 28. 67), and are ⁷
noticed by Horace, Ovid, etc. See the
collection of references in Marquardt,
Sgaatsg. iii. p. 81, Mayor, on Juv.14‚
10

9 5. ea. superstitione. Josephus repre-
sents this enlistment and explusion as re·
lating not to both these bodies bnt to
Jews only. The large number of ewish
freedmen, and the large Jewish sett emeat
in the trans-Tiberine district, are attested
by Philo, who also speaks of a persecu-
tion, but ascribes it to the influenee οἱ
Seia’nus: Leg. ad Gaium, 23, 24, 568,
569(=1014‚ 1015).

6. Sardiniam. rh1s1s1and‚withCorsica,
had originally formed a senatorial province
of the second rank, but, owing to the pr& j.
valence of brigandage, alluded to also by ζ
Varro (R. R. 1. 16, 2), was handed over
to a procurator with amilitary force, from .
759, Α. D. 6 (Dio, 55. 28. 1), until the· j
time of Nero (Introd. vii. p. 94). Its η

‘gravitas caeli ’ had been already men· ’
tioned by Livy (23. 3⁴ 11); Mela (2. 7.
12 3) calls it‘ ut fecunda, ita paene pesti-
lens; ’ and Pausanias (10. 17, 11) speaks
of its ἀὴρ θολερὸς καὶ νοσώδης. ;

8. vile damnum: cp. ‘sacili damno* γ
H. 4. 28,
46, 33
649. The sentiment resembles that on v
the blood of gladiators (1. 76, 5).

10. capiendam virginem. The quali-

5; ‘utile damnum' Vell. ².
‘iactura vilior' Stat. Theb. Ι. ’
