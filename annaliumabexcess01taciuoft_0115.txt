12¹, of ‘consules mffecti ; ' which would tend to produce an increasing
stagnation inthe succession to pmoonsulships. This again was remedied
in various ways. Some consulars were disqualified ¹, others set aside by
the senate· or by Caesam others declined the ‘sortitio ⁶! The lists
also show that the order of seniority was not always adhered to; being
probably modified by the preference enjoined by the ‘ Lex Papia
Poppaea ⁸,’ and probably also by a postponement of the turn of any
who, when their time came, were absent from Rome.

A few words may be added on the extent and resources of these two
provinces, the great prizes left ιο the senatorial award.

Asia on the north was bounded by the line of the Rhyndacus, on the
south by that of the Calbis; the two lines enclosing a kind of triangle‚ having
its apex near Philomelium, and comprising, with nearly all Phrygia,
Mysia, Lydia, and Caria, the Aeoliam Ionian, and Dorian Greek cities,
with most of the adjacent islands, inclusive of the Cyclades ⁷. The chief
city and residence of the governor was Ephesus ; but several others are
entitled μητροπόλεις, two have the rank of coloniae. at least eighteen that
of ⁶ civitates liberae ⁸.' Only a passing reference can here be made to the
frequent prominence of this province in the business before the senate ’ς
and to the evidence of its great resources and high civilisation at all
times¹⁰, as vell as of its gradual recovery from the rav-ages of war and
extortion ; and the general qualities which, in spite of imperial vigilance,
made it in the time of Domitian, hardly less than in that of Cicero ¹¹, a
mre to governors.

Africam bounded on the east by ‘ Philaenorum arae ¹’,’ at the eastern
ηοω· of the Great Syrtis, near Manum while on the west, during the
Jndependenoe of Mauretania, the boundary between them was fixed at
Saldaeu, identified with Budjaya (Bougie). It had thus a coast line
extending some fifteen degrees of longitude, and comprising the greater
part of modern Tripoli, the whole of Tunis, and a considerable portion
ofAlgeria. In the time of Pliny it contained thirty ‘civitates liberae:
