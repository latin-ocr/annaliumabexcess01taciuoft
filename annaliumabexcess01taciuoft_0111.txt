ROME UNDER AUGUSTUS ΛΝΒ TIBERIUS. 93

to Tiberius dwell on the scanty produce of a soil that cannot have been

cultivated to its best¹. Pliny traces the evil to the ‘latifundia,’ which
had extinguished all caresul and energetic husbandry ²3 the words of
Tiberius point scornl'ully to the tracts made wholly unproductive by the
noble mansione with their parks and pleasure grounds ⁸. Probably the
rich and fertile Transpadane district, less devastated by civil war, and
apparently more free from the curse of the chained slave-gange ⁴, may
have formed a contrast to the general state os the peninsula, in which the
huge city, and many flourishing towns, must have made the desolation of
other towns and of the rur-al districts only more evident.

Love os country lise, with its frugal simplicity and healthy habits, is
undoubtedly genuine in Horace ς and the ideal os such a life, or of that of
a retired Italian town, is professedly admired by many a Roman who knew
as little of it as the money-lender Alfius ⁵, or who had little real intention
to take refuge at Cumae with Umbricius ⁸, or to change the perilous
distinctions of Rome for the simple duties os an aedile at Ulubrae ⁷. As a
fact, the tide still set from Italy, as from the rest of the world, to Rome:
nor do sober critics in any age take the ideal pictures os retired lise as
altogether serious. However the contrasts drawn by Roman writers are
so tar substantiated, that Vespasian not only learnt, in a municipal
home, the habits which trained him to be the reformet os imperial extra-
vagance ; but was also enabled, by a stream os new rnen os similar origin.
to recruit the effete Roman aristocracy with an infusion oi' healthier
blood ⁸.

When it is said that the empire at the death os Augustus was bounded
by the ocean or by distant rivers ·, not only are the provinces on the,
African continent lest out ol' sight, but also the northern and eastern
frontiers are very loosely indicated. In speaking of the Rhine as a
boundary, it should be remembered that, besides such outposts as Aliso ¹⁰,
the Batavi, between the branches os its bifurcation ¹¹, and the Frisii and
part οἴ the Chauci wholly beyond it ¹³, were subject to Rome ς while
above Mogtmuacum (Maius), the only frontier definitely known to us is
that ol* the ‘limes ²⁸,' chiefly constructed by Domitian ¹⁴ and Hadrian ¹⁸.
