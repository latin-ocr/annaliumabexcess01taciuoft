1. Tam Stertinius, etc. It is sug-
gested by N ipp. that, as this officer usually
commands cavalry and light troops (see
on c. 60, 4), the ‘ pars equitum‚' mentioned
in c. 63, 5, were led by him, and aster
their retreat execute this service, advanc-
ing from, and returning to Koln. 1t is
perhaps more likely that we have here
some account of the other‘ pars equitum)
who are otherwise unnoticed.

Segimerum. Ve11.(2.118,2) gives
this name also to the father of Arminius.
On the family, see notes on c. 55 57

a. filium. Strabo (7. ι, 4, p. ²92) gives
his name as Σεσὶθακος, and that os his
wife as Ῥαμίς, Οὐκρομίρου θυγάτηρ, ἡγε-
μόνος Χάττιν. Ἀκτουμέρου has been sug-
gested as a correction (see 11. 16, 2).

chief officers abroad, as on the nobility in
old times at Rome <see on 4 63, 3).
Military hospitals, or ‘valetudinaria ' are
mentioned (Veg. 2. 10, etc.)‚ and legions
had their ‘medici ‘ (cp. Inscr. Orell. 448,
3508); but from what date appears un·
certain.

1 1. sibique et prestio timebam ‘ sibi
firmare ¹ (‘to secure to oneself ’) is used
in 3. 603 H. 5. 4, 1. Here, the double
application involves a zeugma. ν

12. triumphalia insignia. The regular
phrasein inscriptions (e. g. Henzen, Index,
p.150; Wilmanns, Index,p. 609)· is ‘trium-
phalia ornamenta3 ’and the term is thus
analog ous to that of· consularia oma-
mentf’ (bestowed from the time of the
dictator Caesar: cp. Suet. Jul. 76), and
others, signifying that the dignity and m-

signia of an office were given without the
office itself. Thus, without an actual
triumph, persons were entitled to be
called · triumphales' (3. 30, 4, εἶα), and
to ennoble their family by ‘laureatae
statuae ’ (4. 23, Ι). Some suppose this ·
minor honour to have been first given to
Tiberius (Suet. Tib. 9). The full honour
of the ‘iustus triumphus: though freely
given during at least the earlier part of
the rule of Augustus (Suet. Aug. 38), is
ever afterwards, probably from 740, Β c.
14 (see Dio, 54. 24, 8), reserved for the
imperial family: see c. 55. 1, etc.

A. caecinae, 1.. Apronio. Ο. silio.
The selection appears to be grounded
on rank (these three legati alone being
consulars); sor the personal service of
Silius is unmentioned, and that recorded
of Apronius (c. 56, 1)trivial. The awai-d,
as that in c. 55, 1, shows that the suooeoe
of the army was exaggerated at Rome.

13. nomen patris pan-im. This title.
already given by acclamation to Cicero
(Juv. 8, 243), and in 709, 1³.c. 45, to
Julius Caesar (App. Β. C. 2. 1c6),was
sormally accepted by Augustus, fromwas the
united voice of senate knights, and people.
ou Feb. 5, 752, B.c. 2(see Mon. Anevi.
34, and Mommsen. ad loc.); but had
probably been informally used much
earlier (ep. Hor. Od. 1. 2, 50). The
case of Cicero negatives the suppositioni
of Dio (53. 18, 3), that some recognition
of a general ‘patria potestas’ was im-
plied in it. Tiberius persisted in his re·
susal (2. 87, 2· Dio, 58. 12, 8); and the
title is absent from his coins and' inscrip-
tions.
