478 CORNELII TACJTJ ANNALJUM [Aue. 777·

centem Cornutum et falso exterritum ; idque facile intellectu, si
proderentur alii : non enim se caedem principis et res novas uno
socio cogitasse.
29. Tum accusator Cn. Lentulum et Seium Tuberonem nomi· 1
5 nat, magno pudore Caesaris, cum primores civitatis, intimi ipsius
amici, Lentulus senectutis extremae, Tubero defecto corpore,
tumultus hostilis et turbandae rei publicae accerserentur. sed hi
quidem statim exempti : in patrem ex servis quaesitum, et
quaestio adversa accusatori fuit. qui scelere vaecors, simul vulgi 2
10 rumore territus, robur et saxum aut parricidarum poenas mini-
tantium, cessit urbe. ac retractus Ravenna exsequi accusatio· 3
nem adigitur, non occultante Tiberio vetus odium adversum
exulem Serenum. nam post damnatum Libonem missis ad 4
Caesarem literis exprobraverat suum tantum studium sine fructu
15 fuisse, addideratque quaedam contumacius quam tutum apud

1. falso: so Halm and Orelli, after etc. The usual explanation given is that
Orsini, on the analogy of other passages cited from Paullus (see Orelli and Nipp.)

(3:60, 53 6. 8, 1; 11.18. 53 G. 36, 1).
Nipp. and Drager retain the MS. ⁸ salsa‚'
which would be an accus. os the class
noted in Introd v. ς 12 d.

si proderentur alii. Probably‘pro-
derentur' is ironical. Is the names of
others were ‘divulged‚' they would clear
themselves, and thus discredit the whole
charge.

2. non enim, etc. This anticipates
the objection that there might have been
none to name but Cornutus.

4. Cn. Lentulum: see c. 44, 1; 1.
27, 1.

Seium Tuberonem: see 2. 20, 2.

7. accerserentur. The MS. has this
form here, and ‘ arcessebat‘ with the same
construction in 2. 50, 1. The evidence
of both the Med. MSS. would go to show
that Tacitus used both forms: see Gerber
and Greef, Lex.

8. exempti, ‘were freed from the
charge! Tacitus elsewhere uses this verb,
in this sense, with a dative, as 2. 55, 3,
etc. According to Dio (57. 24, 8), Len·
tulus laughed aloud at hearing the charge,
and Tiberius said, v‘I deserve to live no
longer, if even Lentulus hate's me.' Dio
places this ease a year later.

ex servis, probably by the fiction
mentioned in 2. 30, 3.

ssgburxzmghr? '‘cTiiill’iaxiginZ’ ἓξὲξ). 3. 50,
ῐ) called by this name in Lucr. (3. 1017)
Hor. (Od.' 2. 13, 19). Liv. (38. 59, 10),

⁶ robus quoque in carcere dicitur is loeus
quo praecipitatur maleficorum genus, quod

ante arcis robusteis includebatur.‘ Prof. ·

Munro (on Lucr. l. l.) not& that some

saxum: cp. ². 32, 5.

parricidarum poenas. These are
partly described in a well—known passage
os Cicero (pro Rosc. Amet. 25, 70), and
more fully in Dig. 48. 9, 9 ⁴ poena parri-
cidii more maiorum haec instituta est,
ut parricida virgis sanguineis verberatus.
deinde culleo insuatur cum cane, gallo
gallinaceo et vipera et simia: deinde in
mare profundum culleus iactatur.’ See
also Juv. 8, 214, and Prof. Mayor's note
there.

1 1. ac osten used at the beginning of ι
sentence, and sometimes where an adver-
sative particle might have been expected:
cp. 14. 64, 1, etc.

12. adigitur. The use of this verb
with inf. (as e. 45, 3; 6. 27, 33 41.
1, etc.) is poetical: cp. Verg. Aen. 6,
6 6, etc.

91 4. suum tantum studium, ‘ that only
his own zeal was unrewarded.' On the
rewards then given see 2. 32, 1. That
Vibius was praetor not later than 770,
A.D. 17, would follow from his havmg
been proconsul of Spain five years aster
that date; whence Nipp. suggests that he
may have had nothing to gain by the de·
eree made in favour of the other aecusers
of Libo.
