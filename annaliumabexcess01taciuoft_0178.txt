by the addition of ‘integri,' and may
pgobably be the meaning of ‘ mos’ in 3.

'L exuta aequalitate. This phrase is
used in 3. 26. 3, of those who seek pre-
eminence. as here of those who accept a
position of inferiority. The application
ot* the'word to political equality (ἰσοτιμία)
appears to be peculiar to Tacitus: see 3.
74, 6; H. 2. 38, 2.

2. seque et. This poetical combina-
tion of conjunctions is found in some ten
places in Tacitus (Dr. ξ 123). On the
following use of ⁸ et’ sor ⁸ etiam,’ see
Id. § 108. ‘Aderat finis' is repeated,
2. ν 1 1.

57. ¹in cassum, ‘idly‚’ as mere decla·
mation.

disserere often takes the accusative in
Tacitus (2. 27, 15 6. 34, 5, eta), as
also in Sall. (Cat. 5, 9), without the re-
striction, usual in Cicero, to the accus. of
pronouns, or of adjectives expressing
&monna as ‘pauca,' ‘multa,' etc. See

1pp.

bellum, i. e. such a military insur-
rection as was in fact imminent.

10, 5). Cp. the analogous uses of ‘dif-
famare aliquem' (c. 72, 4, etc.) and
‘aliquid’ (14. 22, 5).

8. experientia. This sense of ⁸ know-

(
led ge gained by practice‚’ is almost wholly
Vergilian (G. 1. 4, etc.) and Tacitean (as
c. 46, 2, etc.).

Neronem. This name, though still
used here and in c. 5, 6, was dropped on
his adoption. See Introd. ix. note 283
and, on his age and services, Id. viii.
pp. 114, 115.

10. superbia. This characteristic os the
Claudii is repeatedly insisted on by Livy,
(e. g. 2. 56), whom Suet. has followed
(Tib. 2). For the arguments by which
it is maintained that the traditional policy
of this family has been misconceived, see
Mognmsen, Hist. of Rome, vol. i. Ap-

pain et. This would naturally be fol·
lowed by another ‘et’ or ‘neque.' but
the construction, besides the change of
subject in ‘ congestos: etc„ is varied by
the introduction of a climax with ‘ ue . . .
quidem.' ‘Regnatrix’ is ἅπ. dp„ used
invidiously of the ⁴ domus principis’ On
the fondness of Tacitus for such verba}
substantives, see Introd. v, 5 69.

prima ab infantia, etc. On the
events of the early life of Tiberius, see ⁷
Introd. viii. pp. 112, ete. He had only
held two consulships, at the age of 29
and 35; and his triumphal honours ane
maintained by himself and his partisans
(see 3. 47, 5, and note there) to have
been sar below what he could have .
claimed. Tacitus, it should be oboerved,
is not here speaking in his own person.
