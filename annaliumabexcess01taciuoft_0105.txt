’Χῖα ¹ imposed even on the poorest would make many anxious t0 lay down
their rank ⁸, and many outsiders of moderate means well-satisfied not to
enter it ⁸. On the whole, however, such a position was the great object
· of ambition, a'nd admission to its ranks or a rise in them was sought by
fair means or foul. The base side of senatorial character is abundantly
brought before us by Tacitus; on the other hand, it is but sair to recol·
¹ lect that from this class come the series of provincial governors, of
whom few are unequal to their place, and many show high qualities of
the soldier and statesman‚ while even so low a nature as that of L.
Vitellius rises above itself under the responsibilities of power ⁴. At home
again even the pliant Ateius Capito shares with his nobler rival Antistius
Labeo the glory of founding the system of jurisprudence which forms
the greatest legacy bequeathed by Rome to the world ⁵.

The second or equestrian order had also undergone many changes
under Augustus; who, besides reconstituting the iudicial body into four
decuriae each about 1000 strong, of whom the three first were essentially
equestrian ⁸, had also reorganized and frequently revised the list of
‘equites equo publico,’ who, as a more select body within the mass, are
called ‘ equites Romani ' in a stricter sense. Their solemn processione
were revived ⁸¹, and the expectant heirs of the empire, Gaius and Lucius,
becaxm their heads, under the title of ⁴ principes iuventutis ’Β The ‘ius
annulorum,' still, as would appear, not permitted beyond this select
body·‚ was further subjected in the ninth year of Tiberius to stringent
regulations respecting birth as well as census ¹⁰.

From Augustus also dates the rise of a still more select equestrian
aristocracy under the title of ‘ equites illustres ' or other similar names ¹¹ 3
men of senatorial census, or even among the wealthiest in the state ¹²,
who remained within the equestrian rank from choice. Of these the
most famous was Maecenas. and those who filled similar positions in
