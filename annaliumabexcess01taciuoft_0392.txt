1. fiagitii: see Introd. v. §- 35.

2. copiam pugnae. . . facerent. Such
a phrase is elsewhere used of the general
rather than the soldiers: hence Wolfflin
(Jahresb. iii. 786) and Nipp. approve of
Probst's conjecture ‘ faceret.'

3. pro eastris: see on 2. 80, 5.

4. inconditis aut desertoribus. The
troops of Tacfarinas are stated (2. 52, 2)
to have undergone some discipline, but
might still be called ‘inconditi ’ as com-
pared with Roman legionaries. Tac-
farinas was himself a deserter (1. 1.) from
Roman service.

5. exceptat. vulnera. So Halm and

Orelli, after Held, for the MS. ‘excepta‚’

which is retained generally by other
editors, and defended by Nipp. and by
Joh. Miiller (Beitr. 3. 25—28)‚ and which
is explained either by supplying ‘ sunt,’
or by taking the words as an accusative
depending on ⁴ intendit? Against the
first it may be said that, though the change
from an active to a passive construction
and vice versa is not unusual (e. g. ‘ uod
. . . acceptum, neque prohibuit’ c. 723&
gpalggrscglbevhljugg 'inzgheflbeiidxs'fedf’cabatlxvtetg
is here very awkward. As to the second,
the zeugma in ‘intendit‚’ though harsh,
could no doubt be paralleled: but ‘ex-
cepta vulnera . . . intendit‘ (or ⁴ ostendit’)
would be weak, with the definite and
more forcible ‘ transfosso oculo adversum
os’ coupled to it. It is therefore perhaps
easierto suppose that Tacitus wrote ‘ ex-
3333’}02.?'5¹l'„‘t¹}20¹22.531²335h.33 ‘0313‘
wise rare, occurs in Caes„ Cic., and Verg.,

and is used by Silius (9, 367) in a sense
resembling that here required (⁴ per pec-
tora saevas exceptat mortes ¹).

7. suis. This must be taken as a dative
(cp. 2. 50, 4) ς unless, as is not improb-
able, the preposition may have dropped
out.

8. 1.. Apronio: see on 1. 56, 1. Afri-
can coins have been found inscribed ‘ per-

missu L. Aproni procos, iii. (Eckhel‚ iv. ’ψ
148, ete), showing that his proconsulship =

lasted at least beyond two years. He
had probably succeeded Camillus in 771,

A.D. 18, and was suceeeded by Blaesus in κ’
774, A.D. 21 (c. 35): see Introd. vii, '·

p. 96.

10. decumum quemque. Decimation ς
for punishment is mentioned as early as Q

14. 44, 6.

11. sorte ductos fusti necat«. The
words are taken verbatim from Sallust -

The ἶ

(H. 4. 5 D, 27 K, inc. 96 G.)
‘ fustuarium ’ is described by Polybius (6.

37) as inflicted by the fellow-soldiers at a ᾗ

signal from the tribune.

12. velelum veteranorum: see on 1.

17, 4 ; Introd. vii. p. 106.

amplius quam quingenti; so Halm,
and Orelli, after Weissenborn. The MS. 3

has ⁸ quam ’ at the end of a line followed

by ‘genti' at the beginning of the next.
The reading of the old editions, ‘ amplius ’,
quingenti,' is retained by Nipp., and such :2
a construction is sufficiently common. The ¹.
strength mentioued would be about the s-

same as that of a legionary cohort.

14. Thala, probably not the wealthy 11
city of the Jugurthine war (Sall. Jug. 2
