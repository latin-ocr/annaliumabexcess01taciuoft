1. conpressam2‘violatam.’ Sueto-
nius (Tib. 61), as in other cases, exagge-
rates this single instance into a general
practice. Dio (47. 6, 6) gives an instance
in which a youth was made to assume the
toga virilis before being executed.

oblisis· so ‘obliso gutture' App. M.
4. 12, 263. Cicero has ‘collum digi-
tulis oblideret’ (p. Scaur. 6, 10).

2. in Gemonias: cp.3. 14 6, etc. Ac-
cording to the order of events followed
by Dio (58.11‚6>, this execution is made
to precede the revelation made by Api-
cata respecting the murder os Drusus and
guilt of Livia.

4. acri, ‘active: ' so used of‘ causae’
(1. 33, 3), ‘initia' (6. 17, 5, etc), ‘gloria'
and‘ paenitentia’ (H. 3 51, 4), etc.

Drusum. The true Drusus was a
prisoner in the Palatium· see 6. 2 3 5.

6. velut adgnitus, etc. The text here
follows that of the MS„ only adopting
the interlineation (¹ que ’) instead of the
reading of the first hand (‘ qui ’.) Haase
reads‘ velut adgnitus per dolum; quis comi—
tantibusss etc.; but ‘per dolum’ would
thus be surplusage, as ‘'velut of itself
imp lies that the recognition was only
preptended. For the position οἷ’ que’
Nipp. compares ‘ab oratoribusque’ (16.

and note on c. 47, 4). The sreedmen
pretended to recognise him, and as they

dishonestly followed him those who knew

nothing were attracted.

aba, assigning a ground for their readi-

ness to receive him. This characteristic ’
of the Greek mind is noted in the Athe·
nians of that time (Acts 17, 21). On the
estimate generally formed of Greeks by ¹
Romans, see Friedl. i. p. 74: cp. 2. 53, J.

Elsewhere, Tacitus has the accus. with ξ
‘elabi' (as 1. 61, 6, etc.); but in some ξ.
instances from other authors the cases .
generally taken as simple ablativae might ς
be datives, as ‘ telis ’ (Verg. Aen. 2, 318), .
