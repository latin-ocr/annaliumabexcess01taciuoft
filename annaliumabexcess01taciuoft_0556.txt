APPENDIX III.

SUMMARSQ OF EVENTS DURING THE‘ INTERVAL FOR WHICH
THE HISTORY OF TACITUS IS HERE LOST.

SENTENCE soon followed against Agrippina and Nero. The latter was
declared by the senate a public enemy ¹, and both were hurried into
banishment, chained and in closed litters, with strict orders to the escort
to allow none whom they met so much as to stand and look back at
them ². Nero was sent to Pontia (Ponza), Agrippina to Pandateria, the
old prison-house of Julia ³3 where she is said to have been treated with
such violence as to have lost an eye by a blow from the centurion, and
to have had food forced into her mouth when she attempted to starve
herself ⁴. Drusus, who had been used as a tool by Seianus against his
brother ⁶, was for the present left unattacked, and probably during this j
year received Aemilia Lepida in marriage ⁶.

Asinius Gallus, while on a visit to Tiberius at Capreae, was denounced ·
by a secret missive‚ and condemned in absence by the senate, yet not
- put to death or permitted to despatch himself, ,but sent to Rome and ᾗ
detained there in custody in the house of a magistrate, with just food ε
enough forced upon him to support life⁸. His friend Vallius Syriacus j
the rhetorician was put to death for no other cause than his friendship ⁹. ,.
Seianus had now prepared his attack on Drusus by the seduction of his ,-
wife, and made some representation to Tiberius, who sent the young
man back from Capreae to Rome ¹⁰, where a more formal charge, pre- j
ferred through the agency of Cassius Severus ¹¹, caused him also to be‘
pronounced a public enemy ²² and imprisoned in a chamber in- the ss
Palatiumss.
