CHARACTER ANB ΘΟ VERNMENT 01* TIBERIUS. 127

soruess os Capreae ¹. Accepting, on general authority, the eounsel of
this adviser as the primary motive sor such seclusion, Tacitus adds, with
perhaps more than due stress, others which we may place in the second
rank⁸. The dictation still exereised by Augusta, even at the age of

- eighty-five, is intolerable to an almost septuagenarian son, and amounts
ω ει virtual claim to share the power which she had won for him. His
habits of lise are said to have driven him to fly the restraint of society:
even his personal appearance to have led him to shun the eyes of men.
The tau gaunt form, awkward even in its erectness ⁸, has* contr-acted an
mgainly stoop; the oountenance, so refined and distinguished in his
busta and coins, has become a loathsome spectacle.

The period which begins with the concentration of a body-guard seems
sptly to end with almost a sels-imprisonment: and we appear to see a
picture, neither inconsistent nor indistinct, of s phase intermediate be-
tween his best and worst ; one of an old age os increasing tirnidity, sus·
picion, and ischnon, aggravated by a oounsellor whose interest lay in
doing so 3 and tending to bear the (mit naturally borne by such qualities,
when, to the missortune os mankind, they are armed with power.
dilexit timuitve: postremo in scelera simul ac dedecora prorupit, post-
quam remoto pudore et metu suo tantum ingenio utebatur:

These two periods, comprising together eight years and a quarter,
7⁸²·790» ιο. ²9-37· may be taken together, and must in great part be
studied without the sid of Tacitus.

The Fifth Book opens with the death of Augusta„ who. aster having
been charged, by hints more or less explicit, with every death in the
house oi' the eae-ars, is now represented no longer ns the ‘ terrible step-
mother: but a· the sole remaining protection os the family supposed to
have been most obnoxious to her‘. In another place such discrepancies
are loosely accommodaret! by saying that she ostentatiously supported in
adversity those whom she had secretly undennined in their prosperity ⁰.
The verdiet os historia} criticism has generally acquitted her of these
hputstions, and regarded her throughout the long and unhroken period

οί her ssoendancy‚ as ι sostening and moderating influence on the eme!
propensities of her husband and her son. And indeed, whatever her

’ personsl feeling towards the house of Germanicus, we may suppose her
sufficiently imbued with the policy of Augustus ⁸, to see that her son had
far rnore to guin than to lose by surrounding himself with family sup-

3 port; and that it would not be desirable for him st the age οῖ seventy
