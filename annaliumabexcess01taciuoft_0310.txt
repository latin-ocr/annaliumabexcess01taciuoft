privatas opes, idque non novum, sed e vetustissimis moribus:
aliam apud Fabricios, aliam apud Scipiones pecuniam; et
cuncta ad rem publicam referri, qua tenui angustas civium
domos, postquam eo magnificentiae venerit, gliscere singulos.4

sion, here and in 13. 10, 1, is taken from
Verg. Aen. 2, 765. Nipp. notes asimilar
abl. of material in 12. 16, 3 ‘moenia non

ministrandis cibis, i.e. that they
should be used only in sacrifice. Dio (5 7.

σκεύει μηδένα πλὴν πρὸς τὰ ἱερὰ νομίζειν.
This prohibition would appear to have
restricted the use of gold plate at table to
the princeps (see Friedl. i. p. 150); but

olden drinking cups appear to be in use
fatfr among rich private persons (Juv. 5,
392. viros, ‘the male sex.’ Silk was
worn by women in the Augustan age, when
the same transparent garments called
‘ sericae’ by Seneca (de Ben. 7. 9, 5 ; Ep.
90, 20) were known as ‘ Coae ’ to Horace,
Propertius, Tibullus, and Ovid. Such
dresses, unusual amongst modest women,
were worn for summer lightness, even
after this decree (cp. 3. 53, 5), by effe—
minate men (Seu. Ep. 114, 2o; Plin. N.
H. 11. 23, 27, 78), and formed one of
the notable extravagances of Gaius (Suet.
Cal. 5² ; Dio, 59. 12, 2). On the ‘Seres,'
see Mr. Dyer, in Dict. of Geog.

excessit, ‘went further3’ cp. c. 24,
1. This interpretation would be rather
against the genuineness of the words
below ; but in any¹oase it is not necessa
to understand ⁴ relationem‚’ as some su
woid as ‘ceteros’ can be supplied.

tion, on the ground that they describe a
practice of introducing matter wholly out-
side the question (see on c. 38, 3), whereas
Fronto's proposal was not irrelevant. It
was, however, at least, a great extension
of the motion, from a restriction dealin
with two definite points, to a ene =
attack on ostentation in domestic ise. If ’ξ
the passage is genuine, we gather that · j
this privilege of digression was rarely, if
ever, used in the writer’s own time.

9. gliscere ; used of increase in number

in any other sense. ·
