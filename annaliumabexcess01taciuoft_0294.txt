rear of the fugitives (c. 17, 8). The main
body would extend from west to east,
partly on the plain, partly within the out·

been'already mentioned, as ‘levis uma-
tuffitgiftus paratusque. Em. points
out that this is a kind of formula, and
is used in Sall. Cat. 27, ²3 Jug. 49, 3:

skirts of the wood immediately behind
them (see above). The heights occupied
by the Cheruscans appear to have been
on the right wing, and to have formed
the key of the whole position, enabling
them to fall on the flank of the Romans
as they advanced.

γ 2. proeliantibus. Nipp. takes this to
be abl. abs, as Tacitus usually has the
accus. with ‘ incurrere’ (e-g. c. 17, 1 ; 1.
51, 6, etc.).

3. sio incessit: compare the march-
ing order in 1. 51, 5, and note there.

5. praetoriis cohortibus: these are
mentioned again c. 20, 6. Ritter thinks
that the personal guards, belonging to the
two legati. Silius and Caecina, are in-
tended3 and. compares Cic. Ep. ad Fam.

under the name3 and that, as two such
cohor-ts were sent with Drusus to Illyri-
cum (1. 24„ ιδ, two others may have been
sent out to Germanicus. It is also pos-
sible, that, in recognition of his rank, two
such may have originally accompanied
him to Germany.

7. ceteraeque. Ritt. appears rightly
to take these to be troops specially en-
rolled sor this expedition; the auxiliaries

regularly belonging to the legions having

and often in Livy.

8. adsisteret. Tacitus has often this
word in a military sense, usually meaning
to take up a position, as c. 17, 43 19. 4;
12. 56, 3314. 34, 3311. 3. 63, ¹3 82,3.
Here it is taken with brachylogy. aseqni-

‘that the order of march might deploy
into line os battle ; ' i. e. that each should
stand next in line to those to whom they
had been next in column. The army
would appear to have deployed to the
left. as those who had marched first were
facing the Cherusci (c. 17, 6).

occupied, though prominent, affor-ded
cover; and that they were to have been
concealed till the moment of attack (c-
16‚ 4); but their impetuosity betmyed
their position. The attack in flank
appears to be directed against themfthat
isne the rear against those within thewood.

12. augurium, used, like ‘auspiciis’ ,ἒ
(c. 14, 2), of the omen. So in Liv. etc. ³4

The verb is adapted to the noun in apposi-
tion, as in 3. 21, ας 13· 37, 4(where see
Nipp.); 14· 27, 2, etc.

fluously noted, that eagles are now rarely
