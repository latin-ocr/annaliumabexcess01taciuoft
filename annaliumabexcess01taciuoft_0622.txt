that Cic. so uses ‘dictus est ' (ad Q. s. 1.
2, 93 pro Scaur. 6, 11).

1. mortalitatem explevisse, ‘ to have
fulfilled the conditions of mortality.’ The
expression appears to be new, and is ex·
plained by Nipp. as analogous to ‘vicem,
munus explere (4. 8, 73 Dial. 32, 5). It
might also possibly be taken to mean
‘completed the term of mortal 1ife,' like
ωὲἷῗῖἶῖἓέ ἓᾟεῖέῗίῗξέἓὲέῖιίέὶῗέιςᾶἷῗξ
to die, sometimes even = ‘ mors,' e g.

usual. Nipp. compares other similar
descriptions of assumed unconsciousness
(ιι. 35, 1; 13. 16, 5). .

6. in silentium fixus, ⁴ stupefied into
silence:' cp. ‘defixus ’ 1. 68, 2, etc.

novissima, ⁴ the uttermost;’ in full
‘novissima exempla' (12. 20, 4; 15. 44,

2) makes Gaius the chief agent in with-
holding sood from Tiberius, as if it would
hurt him, and pilirig on clothes, as if to
warm him. Suet. (Tib. 73) gives, besides
this, a story of slow poison given by
Gaius; also another account from ‘Sen-
eca? that‘Tiberius made as if he would

rise and fell liseless by the bed. This story,
{ism} ἓὲἒῗὲῖςὲἓῗὲέῗὲῗῖἷῖ ῗξεὶἳῗ
probably represents the version circulated
at the time by Gaius.

Dio (58. 28,

7. iniectu, only here in Tacitus; also
in Lucr.‚ Pl. mai.‚ and Stat.

8. finivit. Elsewhere the expression is
‘ finire vitam ' (1. 9, 1, etc.); but ‘finis’
is thus used absolutely (2. 71, 1. etc.),
and ‘qui morbo finiuntur ’ in Pl. Epp. 1.
12, 23 so that Ritter’s insertion of ‘Vitam’
seems needless.

octavo et septuagesimo. The eal-
culation of Dio (l. l.), that he lived seventy-
seven years, four months, and nine days,
allowing for his error in the date os death
(see above), agrees with the date of birth
given by Suet. (Tib. 5), as Nov. ¹³⁴· 712,
B.c. 4²· Suet. adds (c. 76), that his will.
made two years before, left Gaius and
young Tiberius joint heirs. with legacies
to many persons, to the Vestals, the sol-
diers and people, and, separately, to the
‘vicorum magistri.’ This will was set
aside at the instance of Gaius, especially
in respect of the heirship of young Tibe-
rius, as the will of an insane person (rapa-
φρονήσαντος); but Gaius paid the other
legacies as gifts from himself (Dio, 59. ις
Suet. Cal. 16). We also leam that, in
spite of eries of ‘ To the Tiber with Tibe-
rius,‘ and other expressions of popular
hatred (Suet. Tib. 75), his remains re·
ceived a public funeral at Rome, with a
‘laudatio' from Gaius (Dio, 58. 28, 5).
His memory was however condemned:
for he received no divine honours, nor
were his ⁶ acta’ ever included in the
annual oath of maintenance (Dio, 59.
