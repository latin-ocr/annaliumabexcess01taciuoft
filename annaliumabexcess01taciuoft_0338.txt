1. Cappadoces: cp. c. 42, 6.

Q.. Veranium. He was legatus of
Germanicus and one of the accusers of
Piso (3. 10, 2; 13, 3; 19, 1). Some
identify him with the consul of 802, A. D.
49 (12. 5, 1), afterwards legatus of Britain
(14. 29, 1; Agr. 14, 3), who may more
probably have been 1115 5011.

legatum accepere. He appears
only to have organized the province and
at once returned (c. 74, 2). pCappadocia
became a Caesarian province under a
procurator (ἱππεῖ ἐπετράπη), Dio, 57. 17,
7: cp. 12. 49, 13 Suet. Vesp. 8

3. speraretur, sc. ‘z’fore cp. 3. 8, 1;
6. 41, 2, where Nipp. cites ‘superos

Commagenis. see on c. 42. νῦν δ’
ἐπαρχία γέγονε (strab. 16. 2, 3, p. 749).

Q.. Servaeus. This name is re·
stored by Lips. from 3. 13, 3; 6. 7, 23
sor the MS.· serva eius.’ The first oi
these passages shows that he also was not
a permanent governor.

tore’ of Syria. In 791, A. D. 38, Gaius
again set up a king of Commagene,
Antiochus ΙΙΙ. (Dio, 59. 8, 2); and it
was again taken under Roman govern-
ment, apparently united with S yria, by
vespasian (Suet. Vesp. 8): see Marq uardt.
staatsv. i. p. 240. The dominion of
Philopator of Cilicia (cp. c. 42, 7), which
is not here mentioned, was also probably
annexed to Syria.

post quae rarus

5. socialia. This neuter appears to be
here alone used for ‘ res sociales.' The idea
contained in the whole sentence is subject
of ⁶ habebant: ’ cp. Introd. v. § 65 b, 2.

laetum . . . habebant, ‘did not
keep him pleased:’ cp. c. 65, 1; also

‘sollicitum habere aliquem' Plaut. Men.
4. 2, 21 ; Cic. Fam. 7. 3, 1, etc.

7. filium, M. Piso: see c. 76, 2, etc.

utrumque, i. e. he had sent only a
legatus of lower rank in charge of them.

8. cyrri. Cyrrus, now Choros, gave
its name to Cyrrestica, the northern di-
vision of Syria. It lay on the chief road
connecting Antioch with the bridge over
the Euphrates at Zeugma.

decumae legionis: see Introd. vii. p.
104.

10. ut rettuli: cp. c. 55, 3.

11. intendere : cp c. 38, 6.
. 12. filios. One of the sons had re·
mained 111 Rome (3. 16, 5), but may have

been accused os intriguing there. That -

the proceedings of Germanicus were
watched and reported at home, would
appear from c. 59.

1 3. paneis familiarium adhibitis. The
same expression is repeated in 3. 10, 6.
osan informal board of assessors. Here
they are only witnesses.

14. ira et dissimulatio, ‘resentment
struggling against disguisess i. e. parfially,
but not wholly dissembled. cp. ‘amone
et ira' 13. 44, 6.

15 contumacibus, ‘insolent,² i ..e ‘iron-
ical entreaties.’

discesserunt. The MS. has ‘disces-
