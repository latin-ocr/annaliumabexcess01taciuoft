MS. reading ‘nobilissimarum,' evidently
an error of assimilation‚ are numerous.
For a discussion of them, see Pfitzner, p.
19 ς’ Joh. Miiller‚ Beitr. sect. 3. p. 33.
Most editors adopt ‘ nobilissimam, with
a copulative particle; ‘ occupaverat ' be-
ing' taken by zeugma with ⁴ subolem' in
some such sense as that of ‘ copias occu-
pavisse ' (1. 10, 1). But it appears awk-
ward to introduce a new object after
an apparently completed sentence. This
would be in favour of Bezzenberger’s sug-
gestion (followed by Nipp.) ‘ut nobilis-
simam ’ (followed by ‘ et eo pignore ⁹), or
of the text above, adopted by Halm from
Heins. and Haase: a still nearer approach

2. liberalibus studiis, etc. This
school, which must have been founded by
Augustus, made Augustodunum the great
Roman seminary in Gaul: as Massilia
(Strab. 4. 1, 5, 181) was the centre of
Greek culture. That the school still
flourished till the end of the third cen-
tury is attested by an oration of Eume-
nius, delivered when he was appointed by
Constantius to preside overit, on its re-
storation after the sack of Augustodunum

by barbarians (Panegyrici veteres, iii: see .

also Lips. Exc. on this passage).
operata: so ‘conubiis arvisque novis
operata iuventus‘ (Verg. Aen. 3, 1363 cp.
Hor. Ep. 1. 2, ²9)-
4: quadraginta milia. This must
be taken as the sum of au the Aeduan

forces. At the rising os Vercingetorix
their first contingent, with that of those
subordinate to them, was fixed at 10000
foot and 800 horse, to which was added
a further levy of 3 5000 for the final crisis
(Caes. B. G. 7, 64; 75).

quinta parte sui legionariis armis,
‘to the extent of one fifth, armed as legi-
onaries.’ ‘Legionariis armis· appears to
be rightly explained by Joh. Miiller and
Nipp. as an abl. of quality, similar to
‘ingentibus gladiis et brevibus cetris’
Agr. 36, 1, etc. (cp. Introd. v. 5 29);
but there is an unusual harshnaes in its
immediate proximity to another abl„ that
of the part referred to.

6. gladiaturae, found nowhere else in
any author of repute. ‘Lanistatura ⁹ oc·
curs in the ‘ Tabulae Heraclaeensae: and
Drager notes that several such forms are
introduced in later Latin.

7. gentico. only found in 6. 33, 3; ⁷
Tert. de An. 39.

cruppeuarii. This Celtic word occurs
nowhere else. The same men are called
‘ferrati' in c. 45, 3, and such a kind of ·
unwieldy plate armour (‘cataphracta’)
is described as worn by Sarmatian chiefs ·
in H. 1. 79, 5. The gladiators called
‘mirmillones’ were supposed to repre·
sent the usual Gaulish military equip-
ment.

8. accipiendis inpenetrabiles. No
other instance os this construction appears
to be found; but an ordinary dative (‘in- ¹
penetrabilis irae ’) in Sil. 7, 561.

9. ut . . ,ita: cp. 1. 12, 1, etc. ἱ

10. viritim, ‘of individuals.' Nipp. ·
notes that in 11. 24, 2 ‘ singuli viritim· ἶ
stand in opposition to ‘terrae, gentes?
in Bell. Al. 65, 4 ‘et viritim et publice’ ,,
are contrasted: cp. ‘ipsum viritim’ (‘him- ’ἕ
self individually’) Vell. 2. 16, 3.
