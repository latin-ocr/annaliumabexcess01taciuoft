74 JNTR OD UCTJON.

The most peculiar judicial prerogative, consisting in the right of the
x! princeps to try offences of all kinds in a private court of his own, is
traceable as early as the time of Augustus ¹. This court, usually, but
not invariably ², restricted to cases of criminals of rank, probably arises
srom the validity of the ‘ proconsulare imperium,' and consequent power
of life and death, within the pomoerium ³. Tiberius was asked to try
Cn. Piso, and, after preliminary investigation, exercised his power by
‘remitting' the case to the senate⁴; upon which it was his usual
practice to devolve judicia] responsibility, even in cases most naturally
belonging to his personal jurisdiction ⁶. We find instances of such private
trials after his retirement to Capreae ⁶, though even then he more
commonly calls in the consuls and senate to pass sentence on the
record sent to them ⁷. After him, these private courts became such an
engine of tyranny⁸ as to lead to a reaction under the Flavian Caesars ⁹.
From this high criminal jurisdiction flows that delegated to others, as to
the ‘praefectus urbis' at home ³⁰, and ⁶ legati ’ in the provinces,who however
wereobliged to allow the appeal to Caesar, in capital charges affecting a
Roman citizen ¹¹.

The civil jurisdiction of the princeps sitting persomlly, whether as a
court of first instance or of appeal, is also found as early as the time of
Augustus 1² and Tiberius ¹⁸. This also might be, and was delegated‚ with
appeal from the delegate to the delegant. On this subject most of the
information comes from jurists of much later date ¹⁴.

We also trace an informa] board of assessors as well as delegates.
from the earliest date ¹⁵ till the retirement to Capreae, and again under
Claudius 18; which passed, at a later time, into a permanent body of
salaried jurists.

This body is distinct from the more definite political cabinet or com-
mittee of twenty senators, regularly appointed in virtue of magistracy or
by lot ¹⁷, for discussion of questions to be afterwards submitted to the full

house 18; though these persons might also occasionally act as judicial,
assessors ¹⁹.
