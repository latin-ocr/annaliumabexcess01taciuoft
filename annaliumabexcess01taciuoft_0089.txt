 

CONSTITUTION oF THE EARLP PRINCIPAJE. 71

still oemains of the ‘lex de imperio Vespasiani ¹,' which, though appar·
ently conveying in form the tribunitian power, specifies sar more preroga·
2 tives than belong to the conception of that office, and must either be
s* taken to show an almost indefinite extension οἱ its idea ², or to include
ζ other powers vested in the princeps. That this power would os itself
give full right to convoke and consult the senate, as well as to control⁸
⁷ its decisions, is matter of course: we find also that the princeps could
ν dispense with legal formalities in summoning it ⁴, and could, when absent,
, bring before it in writing a certain number os motions, which took prece-
s, dence os all others³3 and when Caesar in person put the question, the
Ϊ magistrates so far became ‘privati' as to be asked their ‘sententia‘ ς '
while he himsell'either guided their decision by speaking first, or reserved
himself to the end ⁷, so as either by formal veto ⁸ or less formal modifica-
tion⁹ to amend the proposals of others. It appears also that the ‘ius
¹ auxilii, ad tuendam plebem,’ and general coercive power even originally-
emended amile beyond the pomoerium ¹⁰, and must ultimately have been
amestricted by any limit os distance ¹¹, We can thus readily understand
the description by Tacitus of this power as ‘ a title of supremacy devised
by Augustus, to make him pre-eminent over all other authorities, without
assuming the name os king or dictator ¹²!

111. The remaining magisterial stinctions are chiefly censoria! or
[consular-censoria! ¹⁸. The censorship itself seu into abeyance from
730, ac. 24, till it was assumed temporarily by Claudius ¹⁴, and sor lise
by Domitian ¹³. But Augustus, besides permanently assuming the
‘regimen legum et morum ¹⁰,' makes use on one occasion (726, ac. 28)
of his consulship, and twice (⁷⁴⁶ and 767, ac. 8, m). 14)of an ‘im-
perium consulare ¹⁷,' to bold a ⁴ census populi: with which, on each
occasion, a formal ⁸ lectio senatus ' appears to have been ioined ¹⁸: he also.
