>works lost. Thus it was not only the disaffected Roman nobility that
felt a lesden rule upon them: far higher elements of national lise are
stagnating under peril and suspicion3 and the result is a barrenness of
intellectual activity, compared to which even the time os Nero or Domitian
is an age os fertility.

CHAPTER IX.

GENEALOGY OF THE FAMILY OF AUGUSTUS AND OF THAT
01³· THE CLAUDIAN CAESARS, wl'rH NOTES.

Ovum to constant intermarriages between members oi' the imperial
family, the relationships between many of the persons whose names
occur in these tables are extremely intricate, even without considering
the further complication introduced by adoptions. Thus the children

. of Germanicus are on their mother’s side direct descendants of Au·

gustus, and on their father's side direct descendants os Octavia, as well

as descendants of the Claudian house. The emperor Nero, besides ι

partaking os all these relationships through his mother, was also directly

ε descended from Octavia on his father's side. Au the descendants of
² Drusus, brother oi' Tiberius, trace a similar descent through Antonin ‘
’ the children os Drusus, son of Tiberius, become members oi* that
’ family through Livium and the children of Claudius by Messalina are
v again through her father and mother doubly descendants of Octavia.

Tiberius and the two Drusi, his brother and son, are thus the only
members os the Claudian stoclt who stand in no blood-relationship
to Augustum and Stem B might have been almost wholly included

' under A.

, It is hoped that the arrangement here adopted will indicate intel-

ἱ ligibly all the relationships of consanguinity. Of the adoptione, the
J most important to bear in mind are those ol* Octavius by the will oi
Julius Caesar, of Tiberius by Augustus, os Germanicus by Tiberius,

·' and of Nero by Claudius.
