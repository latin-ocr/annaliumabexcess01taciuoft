Nora—Several of the works on this subject are mentioned by Nipp. (Introd. p. 33);
to whose list of various judgments may be added the vigorous desence of Tiberius by
Professor Beesly (⁶ Catiline‚ Clodius, and Tiberius‚' London‚ 1878), the more modified
praise in M. Duruy’s History, the more unfavourable view taken by M. Boissier in his
work, ‘L’Opposition sous les Cesars’ (especially ch. 6, on the delatore), and the
unmeasured invective of Comte Champagny (Les cesars, i. p. 280-360).

Many obligations, not easy to specify in their places, must be here admowledged
to several of these works3 but my chief endeavour has been to give an independent
judgrnent on the facts and interpretations of facts contained in Tacitus and other
original authorities,

TAcrrth would undoubtedly wish his readers to take, as his most
deliberate judgment on Tiberius, the summary at the end of the Sixth
Book, where his life is marked out into periods, showing a gradual
moral deterioration‚ affecting both his private habits and personal
government1. It will therefore be convenient to examine these suc-
*cessively.

vixerat:

This emphatic praise, from so unfavourable a witness, though perhaps
qualified by insinuations of latent cruelty ², and tales, which we seem
intended to believe, of a foretaste at Rhodes of Capreae ες must at least
be taken as an admission that his public life to his 56th year was un-
irnpeachable, and seems to carry with it a disbelief in the tales of
drunkenness caught up by Suetonius ⁴. ’ξ

‘From earliest infancy‚‚his lot was one of peril ⁵! Born in the
year of Philippi⁶ (712, B. c. 42), he shared in unconseious infancy the
hurried ssight of his parents from Perusia3 was only four years old when
