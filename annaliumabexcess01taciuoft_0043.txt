TA CI TUS‘ USE' OF HIS MA TERIALS. 25

lsyrta cannot be dated before 785, tm. 3² ¹. This again is met by refer-
{sing ‘confestim ' to Piso alone ; which, is open to no other objection,
”spoils the point of the story by destroying the plausible connection ot'
. cause and effect, and by making Suetonius gravely connect this appoint-
ῖ merit with a debauch os some fifteen years before it, when the consul·
· ship' and the governorship os Moesia⁸ had intervened. The suggestion
, is mrely more probable that Tacitus was aware of this story, saw its
’ inconsistency with facts and dates, aud rejected it without even noticing it.
’ In spite, however, of his diligence, his firm conviction of his own
⁵ impartiality, and his belief that he treads on firmet ground in describing
ἡ times further off from his own, it has been the general verdict of modern
Δ criticism, that ‘ the Histories os Tacitus are more to be relied on than hia
, Annals⁴‚' and the latter are even maintained to be ‘ almost wholly
satire ⁸.' The very excellences of the book are also noted as its desecta.
⁴ 1t isnot in the bare facts, which, as stated above, are rarely known to be
ettoneous, and not osten suspected of being so ς but in the artistic treat-
ment osche facts, the brilliant colouring‚ the effective contram, above all,
1 in the subtle interpretation ol' motives, that the inJustice is mostly con-
· oeived to lurk.

Again, the further he recedes from his own time, the greater, instead
os the less, becomes the suspicion os unsairness. His portraiture of

Claudius and Nero is less assailed than that of Tiberius, which, although

tbe most elaborate analyais of character in all his writings, is also most

lt will be the work οῖ other chapters to follow him in detail through

¹¹ the whole period, and to point out such inconsistencies and unfairnesses
.’ aa may seem traceable: but we may here notice such general considera-

tton- ιι make it probable that he has dealt less than justice to the early

s Caesars.

One chief cauae will be found in the fact that in the Annals generally,

and in the early portion especially, he is beyond the limita of his own
knowledge, and forced to depend on written authorities3 and in the
ι detecta os his own and their methods of dealing with historical evidence.

The Roman critical faculty, never so keenly on its guard against

:j haoenracy in substance aa against solecisms in language0, seems
&generally to have spent the soree os its historical Judgment in dealing
with discrepancies between insol-manis, without recognising the in-
mfficleney of even their united testimony to establish what was beyond
