were sent to Caesar in his absence (Suet.
Tib. 73). and their compiler must have
been so sar in his confidence as to receive
instructions to suppress record of anything
obnoxious. On the construction of‘ cre-
ditus, ’ see Introd. v. 5 45.

1. fatali quodam motu, ‘impelle d
so-ehow by his destiny3’ i. e. by some
inexplicable motive: see on 3. 3ο, 7.

constantiae, ‘courage3' as 1. 32, 1;
15. 55, 7, etc.

2. prava, ‘misguided;’ i. e. mistaking
his true interest. It is explained by
the following words: he overlooked the
present danger of thwarting Caesar, on
the uncertain chance that he might
change his mind and punish them for
their zeal.

3. pavet. The accus. with this verb
is gogicah. but found in Sall.HCat. 3ὲ, 3,
an ma1.cp1 11, 2 , ,
and the use of‘ ‘pavsescere' (1. 4, aa ‚5etc.?)›‚
and‘ expavescere ’(H. 2. 76, 3).

inserere se: so in H. 2.19,3; cp.
6. 2, 1; Ovid‚ etc.

relationem inciperent. The same
phrase is used in 13. 26, 2.

4. brevibus momentis summa verti,
‘small things turn. the scale in great
’ i e. some influence too slight
now to be foreseen may change Caesar’s
whole purpose. The sentiment is that
of Cicero (Phil. 5. ιο, 26)‘ minimis mo-
mentis maximae inclinationes temporum
finntz’ cp. ‘momenta deficientis' Agr.

compares ‘breve pondus Hor. Sat. 2.

posse . . . seni. The corrupt MS.
text‘ germanicis titium paenitentiae senis’
has exercised the ingenuity of all com-
mentators. Walther has collected some “
fourteen suggestions which had found ,2
more or less favour down to his own ἕ
time. For others, see Halm (Comm. j
Crit.;) Pfitzner (p. 100); Ritter (Rhein. :⁴
Mus. xvii. p. plgo). The above reading
(Halm and Nipp.) would express what
must have been the sense of the original ’
text; and the absorption os· esse? be- ,

probable that some words amnunting to

a whqle line in an original MS. may have ’
been ost.

similar mode of showing attachment to ν
Octavia (14. 61, 1).

‘omnibusss corrected in the marg-m 3
‘ominibus; ’ but Walther's defence os
‘festis' by reference to 12. 69, 1, etc.. is
insufficient: any sestal expressions would g¹
have been wholly out of place3 yet men
desired to profess due lo yalty to Caesar, ’ᾗ
and to regard him as the dupe of Seianus. j
