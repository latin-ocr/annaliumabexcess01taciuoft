meets either as a deliberative¹ or judicial² body‘. They can'also still ’
issue edicts to the people ³, and a survival even os their old summary
power of life and death is yet traceable ⁴. It is indeed probable that the
other magistrates, both through increase of their number, and through
transference of many of their duties to imperial officers, must have often had
s merely honorary functions; still, of the twelve praetors, the two soremost
have their old ‘iurisdictio ⁵,' and others preside at the ‘ quaestiones per-
petuae⁶;’ also the important charge of the aerarium ⁷, and the ‘cura
ludorum,' transferred from the aediles ⁸, belonged to this body. The
,„‚‚aediles, of whom probably two were curule and four plebeian, though no
doubt relieved os their ‘ cura annonae ' by the ‘ praefectus: retain a certain
‘cura urbis' with power to regulate markets and prices ⁹, to control

places of public resort ¹⁰, and to impose fines ¹¹.

The ten tribunes of the people appear still to have retained their seat
xj of honour in senate ¹² and theatre ¹⁸, their viatores ¹⁴, and also their ‘ ius re·
lationis¹⁵,’ and, on sufferance, even their ‘intercessio ¹⁶! Of the quaestors,
two ’ are charged with communication between Caesar and the senate ¹⁷;
four, until the time of Claudius, have ‘provinciae‘ in Italy 18; one is
attached to each consul¹⁹ 3 one accompanies the “proconsul to each sena-
torial province ²⁰. This office would be always keenly sought ²¹, as
admitting to the senatorial rank with all its duties and privileges; the

⁴ praetorship and consulship, again, or, failing them, the ‘ornamenta’ of ’
such offices, would be the highest objects of senatorial ambition‚ not
only as adding to the ‘nobilitas' of families, but as stepping-stones to
provincial governments,· the praetorship to those of the lesser provinces,
the consulship, both to the greater Caesarian provinces and to the great
senatorial prizes of Asia and Africa. On the other hand, the offices of
