name drop out of sight, and he becomes ‘ Imp. Caesar. iii vir R.P.C. ¹.’
From this must be distinguished the ‘ nomen imperatoris,’ which also

· he now began to assume as a permanent title. This was given, as in

old times, by acclamation on the field of battle ², and was received by
Augustus twenty-one times in his life⁸‚ for victories gained in person
or through lieutenants43 of which he had already numbered seven in

Appian and repeated by Orosius, stating that he was in that year
chosen tribune for life⁷; or that followed by Dio, according to which
the sacrosanctity and seat of a tribune were decreed to him in this
year, and the power itself in 724, ac. 30⁸5 he will in either case have

and now claims a power quasi-dictatorial‚ or a virtual concentration of
the whole triumvirate in himself, not, apparently, by formal vote, but· by
general consent. ‘Iuravit in meayerba tota Italia sponte sua, et me

Also, after a short second consulship in 721, 13.c. 33, he enters on
a continuous series of nine consulships, his third to his eleventh,

723-731, 13.c. 31-23.

which he then bore, but makes no mention of the tribunitian power :—
