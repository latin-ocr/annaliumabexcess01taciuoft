52. C. Sulpicius D. Haterius consules sequuntur, inturbidusl

sed alia sumptuum, quamvis graviora, dissimulatis plerumque2
pretiis occultabantur3 ventris et ganeae paratus adsiduis ser-
monibus vulgati fecerant curam, ne princeps antiquae parsimo-

niae durius adverteret.

nam incipiente C. Bibulo ceteri quoque 3

aediles disserueram, sperni sumptuariam legem vetitaque uten-
silium pretia augeri in dies, nec mediocribus 'remediis sisti posse.
et consulti patres integrum id negotium ad principem distulerant.

1. ante diem decimum. The latter
word, absent from the MS„ must evi-
dently have stood in the original text
before or after ‘diem‚’ as appears from
Suet. Tib. 75 3 Dio, 1.1. Pfitzner (p. 97)
shows that, according to Quint. Decl. 313,
the interval appears later to have been
extended to thirty days.

ad aerarium. The registration of a
decree of the senate in the ‘aerarium'
was essential to its validity: cp. 13. 28,
3; Livy, 39. 4, 83 Suet. Jul. 28.

2. non . . . libertas. On the prero-
gative of pardon¹ now vested in Caesar,

'see Introd. vi. p. 73. lt is evident, here

and elsewhere, that the senate had still
liberty of choice in the original sentence.

3. interiectu. The use of this word
of an interval of time, in the abl„ is espe-
cially Tacitean (cp. 3. 67, 43 6. 39, 2),
and is copied once by Aur. Viet.

4. 0. Sulpicius, the same person who
is called ‘ C. Galba ' in 6. 40, 3, the elder
brother of the emperor Galba (Suet. Galb.
3). On the other consul, see c. 49, 4.

inturbidus . . . annus. The construe-
tion is here somewhat strained for con-
ciseness of expression3 ‘annus ‘ stands in
apposition to ⁸ consules,’ as ‘ consules ' to
‘annum’ in Liv. 4. 30, 12, and the abla-
tives follow as if the words had been
‘ turbidus non extemis rebus sed sus-
pecta severitate? ‘ Inturbidus ' is wholly
a Taeitean word, used passively here and
in 14. 22, 5; actively in H. 3. 39, 4.

5. suspecta severitate, ‘through an
apprehension of strict measures : ' cp. the
use of ‘suspectus ' with ‘insidiae ' (4. 70,
7), ,‘ proditio' (1 π. 14, 3), ‘incundia ’
(H. 1. 10, 2), etc.

6. prodigitur: cp. H. 1. 20, 3; the

verb had been used in this 'sense by Sal-
lust (oratio Lepidi 17), and before him
by Plautus.

7. alia sumptuum. On the genitive,
cp. Introd. y. ξ 32 b.

8. ganeae, strictly = ‘popinae‚’ but used
generally of seasting in H. 2. 95, 4, etc.
Orelli notes that coarse words are used to
show contempt.

paratus: cp. ‘lauto cenare paratu’
Juv. 14. 13; also c. 55, 3, etc.

9. princeps antiquae parsimoniae:
cp. ‘antiqua parsimonia’ 12. 53, 5, and
‘antiquo cultu victuque' c. 55, 5.
the example set by Tiberius in the ex-
penses os the table, see Suet. Tib. 34.

ιο. adverteret: cp. 2. 32, 5.

11. aediles. It was part of their duty
to regulate the market: see Introd. vi.
p. 76; Mommsen, Staatsr. ii. p. 489, etc.

sumptuariam legem. Gellius (2. ²4)
mentions a '‘lex Iulia' of Augustus and
an edict by him or by Tiberius, both of
which limited the amount that might be
spent on the dinner for common or festa!
days. This ‘ lex,' which is probably the ·
one here referred to, was passed in 732,
Β. c. 22 (Dio, 54. 2, 3; Suet. Aug. 3⁴)-

utensilium: cp. 1. 70, 6. Suet.'(Tib.
34) speaks of three mullets having been
at that time sold sor 30,000 H. S. Another
story is told by Seneca (Ep. 95, 42) of ’
Ρ. Octavius buying by auction for 5000
H. S. a single mullet, which had bem
presented to Tiberius and sold by his ,
order.

12. sisti posse, sc. ‘rem.' Tacitus fol-
lows Livy, who has ‘ut consuetis reme· κ
diis sisti posset’ (3. 20, 8).

13. consulti patres. Nipp. notes ,
that as the aediles had not themselves 7
