CORNELII TA CI TI ANNALIUM [A.U.C. 768.

tante Pompeio Macro praetore, an iudicia maiestatis redderentur,
exercendas leges esse respondit. hunc quoque asperavere carmina 5
incertis auctoribus vulgata iri saevitiam superbiamque eius et dis-

cordem curn matre animum.

73. Haud pigebit referre in Falanio et Rubrio, modicis equiti· l
bus Romanis, praetemptata crimina, ut quibus initiis, quanta
Tiberii arte gravissimum exitium inrepserit, dein repressum sit,
postremo arserit cunctaque corripuerit, noscatur. Falanio obicie· 2
bat accusator, quod inter cultores Augusti, qui per omnes domos
in modum collegiorum habebantur, Cassium quendam mimum
corpore infamem adscivisset, quodque venditis hortis statuam

Augusti simul mancipasset.

in ι 5. 49, 6, and with accus. of the report
spread in 14. 22, 5: cp. the similar uses
of ‘ differre' c. 4. 3.

1. Pompeio Macro. On his parentage
and death, see on 6. 18, 4.

iudicia . . . redderentur. This is
not strictly equivalent to‘ ius reddere'
(‘t0 give sentences eg ..6 11,1; 13.51‚
1, etc), but rather tog‘ iudices dare,’ i. e.
to receive a case and assign jurors to try
it: cp. ‘iudicium redditur an reus sit
causa mortis ’ Quint. 7. 4, 43.

2. exercendas leges. From this an-
swer to the praetor it is to be gathered
that, besides the numerous irials for
‘ maiestas’ held before the senate, which
alone are reported by Tacitus, other per-
sons, apparently of lower rank, must have
been tried under this law before the
com-ts.

carmina. Some such pasquinades are
quoted by Suetonius (Tib. 59). Pa-
conianus was charged later with a similar
offence (6. 39, 1).

3. discordem eum matre animum:
cp· 3· 64, r ; 4· ⁵7³4·

5. modieis equitibus. Those are
meant who had little or no more than
the bare equestnan census, as distinct
from the‘ illustres equitesst on whom see
2. 59, 4. Cp. ‘modicos senatores’ 11. 7, 7.

6. praetemptata, ‘ssessayed apoetical
word, found in prose from Pl. mai.

7. dein repressum sit, etc. It is

s possible, witn'Walther, to extend ‘Tiberii

arte’ to these words, as denoting‚ not any
special period of repression during his
time (for the reference to 3.56, 1 is irre-
levant to this law), but his general tend-
ency, during all the years immediately
succeeding this revivayl os the laW, to
moderate the zeal os accusers andei· it.

Rubrio crimini dabatur violatum

See Introd. viii. p. 12², etc. Or we may,
with Nipperdey, limit ‘Tiben'i arte' to
‘ inrepserit‚' and find the period of repres-
sion in the interval before its revival noted
in 815, Α.ι). 62 (14. 48, 3). Lipsius under·
stands it of the reaction under Vespasiani
and Titus; but the words of Tacitus seem
to confine the periods at least within the
limits of this work. The subsequent out·
burst (‘ postremo arserit ’ etc.) might, no
doubt, equally suit the history of the last
years of Tiberius, or of Nero, or of Domi·
tian.

9. cultores Augusti. Similar titles
are found in inscriptions, e. g. ‘imaginum
domus Aug. cultores' (Orell. 738); ‘-cul
tores domus divinae et fortunae Aug? (Id.
1662). The ‘'cultus of Angustus and
his family' in private houses is illustmted
by the description in Ovid (ex P. 4. 9,
ιο5-ιιο) of a shrine in his own house
with images of Augustus, Augusta, Tibe-
rius, and the two grandsons. The present
passage shows that such private ‘'cultus
had existed while Augustus was living‚' ιιι
a form probably analogous to the muni·

cipal worship (see on c. 10, 5:) also that
the greater houses (⁸ domus' ) kept up sor ’ ’

it, each for themselves or in combination,
a body or bodies of persons of low rank, “
who were constituted, as it were, in ‘col-
legiass i. e. were analogous to the ‘colle a
cultorum' of a less private character. ιι
the general subject of this ‘scultus see
Marquardt, Staatsv. iii. p. 443, etc.

10. habebantur, ‘were keptu
‘mos habebatur'(13.16,1)‚an‹l’ftl1acn
instances, collected 3here by Nipp., of
more or less kindred uses of this verb in
Tacitus and Sallust.

ιι. statuam Augusti . . . mancipas-
set. Lipsius quotes the maxim ofjurists
