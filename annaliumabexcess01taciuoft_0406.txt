but does not seem to be constant to it in
any word (e.g. ‘luxui ’ 14. 15, 3). Gellius
(4. 16) treats the question between the
forms in -‘ u ’ and —‘ui' as an open one,
giving instances of the former not only
from Lucilius and Vergil, but from
Caesar; but, on the strength of a dictum
of Priscian (7, ξ 88), that such forms
are poeticaL editors (as Ritter 1864) have
sometimes corrected those in prose.

2. mox. The death of Maecenas took
place in 746, B.c. 8 (Dio, 55. 7, ι). His
retirement from public affairs, alluded to
below and in 14. 53, 3 (cp. Suet. Aug.
66 ; Dio, 54. 19, 6), had taken place
eight years earlier.

6. fato. This appears to be a causal
ablative3 another alternative cause being
suggested by ‘ an satias capit ’ (cp. ‘ pa-
vore an . . . retinens ' 2. 38, 9): ‘from the
satality by which influenee is rarely per-
manent, or because,' etc. ⁴ ‘ Fatum is
often with Tacitus assumed as a cause of
what he cannot explain (see Introd. iv.
p. 22); to which here, as in 13. 12, 2, the
alternative of some traceable cause is

represents people as already saying that
it was ominous to be consul with Tibe·
rius, a foreboding which the seqnel of
this and of his fifth consulship in 784,
A.D. 31, bore out; it being a strange co-
incidence that, of all his coueagues, four
(Quintilius Varus, Cn. Piso, Drusus, and
Seianus) were known, and the fifth (Ger-
manicus) popularly believed, to have died
violent deaths. On the use of ‘colle- .

this reading for the MS. ¹ biennio ;’ which Ξ

similar difficulty (or perhaps error of the ’

so close an association in respect of birth: ³
The expression is inexact through brevit„ ,
the meaning being that the association in Α

of so near a natural relationship. For ἐ·
this sense of ‘natura,’ compare the phrase ξ
‘natura pater' (Ter. Ad. 1. ², 46; 5-7, ξρ
4). The word is here thrown in, because 3
