1. quorum, ‘such thingsz' the word
refers to the whole matter. N ipp. com-
pares Cic. ad Fam. 2. 8, 2 ‘sermonibus
versatus sum, quae nec possunt scribi nec
scribenda sunt.'

2. studiis, the partialities of certain
senators to particular cities.

consulibus. For another such refer-
ence of a matter to the consuls by the
senate, see 14. 17, 3.

3. si. This is best taken with Nipp. as
depending on ‘perspecto‚' with> the sense
of ‘whether:' cp. 1. 48, 1. ‘Circum—
specta ’ has an analogous double construc-
tion in 14. 33, 2 ε see Introd. v. 91, 8 ; and
note on 1. 15, 4.

’ involveretur, ‘should be
lently concealed in the claim.’

5. Pergamum. This city, the site of
which still retains the name os Pergamo
or Bergamah, situated in Mysia near the
junction of two other streams with the
Caicus, became very important from the
time of Lysimachus under its own princes ;
whose kingdom, bequeathed to Rome,
formed the original province of Asia. It
still remained a famous city, being esti-
mated to consist of 40,000 citizens and
120,0oo inhabitants, able to vie with
Smyrna and Ephesus, and, in the judgment
of Pliny (N. H. 5. 30, 33, 1265, ‘longe
clarissimum Asiae-2 ' see Marquardt,
Staatsv. i. p. 184, 188, etc. For an ac-
count of the very important recent disco-
veries made on its site, see Perry‚ Greek
and Roman Sculpture, ch. xlvi.

Aesculapii. The worship of this
god was brought there from Epidaurus
(Paus. 2. 26, 8); and the temple was
situate outside the city (Id. 5. 13, 2).

6. zmyrna-eos. The MS. here has
‘Zmymetis,’ the margin ‘Smyrnae0s3’

fraudu—

dated srotn the Alexandrian epoch; the
old city north of it having been mined by
Alyattes (Hdt. 1. 16, 2), though still in—
habited κωμηδόν (Strab. 14. 1, 37, 646).
Its importance has been mentioned in the
note above. It is the most considerable
city of modern Asia Minor, having still a
population of over 150‚000.

7. StratonicidiVeneri. Nipp. rightly
notes that this worship, being instanced as
one obscure from its antiquity, can have
no connexion with Stratonice (see on c.
62, 2) in its origin, though no doubt after-
wards associated with her honour ; as the
names seem to have some relation to each
other in an inscription of Seleucus Cal-
linicus confirming the asylum (C. 1. G.
3137). Ἀφροδίτη Erpa-romnis (Inser. 1.l.
and 3 156) must therefore be identical with
Ἀφροδίτη Στρατεία or Νικηφόρος, the ori-
ginal of the Roman ⁶ Venus Victrix.’ This
temple is mentioned as the Stratoniceum
by Vitruvius (5, 9).

8. Tenios. Tenos like the other Cy-
clades, belonged to the province of Asia.

In Strabo's time (10. 5, 11, p. 487) its e

town was small, but its temple os Poseidon

outside the walls large and celebrated, -

Strabo (13. 4, 5, 626) mentions its temple
