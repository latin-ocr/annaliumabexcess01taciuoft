1. tirone, sing. as frequently ‘miles,’
‘ eques,' etc. On the forces here spoken

of, see above, e. 78, 3.
2. in numerum legionis composu-

9. dempto, ‘precipitousz' cp. 4. 45,
1; 6. 21, 2; Lucr, Liv., etc.

10. veterani. This word is not here
strictly used, but only of trained legio-
naries, as opposed to ‘ tirones' (cp. 1. 28,
8), or to mixed troops.

ordinibus ao subsidiis, ‘in centuriae

erat, ‘he had formed into a body nume-
rically equal to a leg ion. ' A similar ex-
pression is used of Catiline in Sall. Cat.

56, 2 ‘legiones (duas) numero expleve-
rat? The nearly similar expression, in
Η 1. 87,1, has (according to Nipp.) a
different meaning. On this soree of‘ in‚'
cp. Introd. v. § 60 b.

5. provincia. The MS. has ‘provin-
ciam3' but we cannot say ‘arceor pro-
vinciam3 ' nor can we well (with Pfitzn.
p. 159) t’ake the words to mean that the
province (i. e. its population) was debar-
red from joining him; for‘ arceri’ must
clearly have the same subject as‘ venire?

4. accitu3 only used in abl. sing„
and apparently only found here and in

Cic. Verr. ii. 3. 28, 683 Verg. Aen. 1.
672: consisterent, i. e. they had only to
stand in line, there would be no battle.
6. pugnaturis, concise abl. abs, as
‘daturis’ 15. 52, 3, etc.: cp. Introd. v.

ξ {ilat-entem, c. 55, 4.-

7. si iure ageretur. On the apparent
reminiscenee here of Livy, see Introd v.
ξ {⁷ ²·

,1110 munimentis. This, like‘ pro
oasgtris' 5. 20, 23 ‘pro muris' 14. 25, 1,
appears clearly f⁹rom the rest of the pas-
sage to mean ‘outside the fortifications.’
On the more usual meaning, cp. c. 15, 4.

and reserves? On the abl. see Introd.
v. ξ 28.

hine . . . inde, opposed, like ‘hinc'
. . . ‘illinc:' cp. 13. 58, 3.

1 1. asperitas. The strong difference in
the senses of this word as applied to
soldiers and places makes the zeugma
here harsh; but the supposition that· vis’
or‘ virtus’ has dropped out §see Halm.
Comm. Crit ) seems needless. ‘Asperitas'
is used, of persons, generally in a bad
sense3 but‘ asper’ is a Vergilian general
epithet os battle, and of warlike nations
(Aen. 1, 14) or persons (Id. 11, 664).

12. agrestia. Nipp. compares the de·
{{{;}3‘¹?a¹10133¹..³;gat{{.q².122›²}⁵1.⁰.v.⁸.}‘}‘3,¹¹‘⁶¹35
and the description of the Catilinarian
army in Sall. Cat. 56, 3.

aut ad. The MS. has ‘aut' alone,
which Nipp. follows the old edd. in alter-
ing to ‘.’ad This would make the sen
tence further describe the rustic weapons:
it is perhaps better, by reading‘ aut ad’
(with Weissenb. )‚ or ‘aut subitum· inusum'
(with Doed.), to make it describe other
weapons, more distinetly warlike, but ex-
temporised.

in manus, ‘to close quartem! In

this sense Tacitus seems to prefer to use ⁵
