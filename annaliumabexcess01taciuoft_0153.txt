between a timid or cautious foreign policy and a career of conquest;
possibly even between a prince beyond au others parsimonious in build-
ing¹‚ and the grand architectural achievements of Trajan. Other con-
trasts were ready to hand within the work itself, helping him to set off
the qualities of Tiberius by the idealised virtues‘of Germanicus ³, or even
by the character of the hasty and passionate but not ungenerous Drusus'.

still, when all this is allowed sor, much remains. The stages and
periods of change noted by Tacitus can be on the whole made out,
though we should consider the explanation put into the mouth of Arruntius,
that the character os Tiberius ⁴ had been thrown off its balance by the
soree os despotism ’,’ to be nearer the truth than the theory adopted by
the historian as his own, that of a true character asserting itself by slow
degrees against the disguise of hypocrisy ⁸.

We have on the whole the character os a prince whose friends might
well have written ⁸ infelix vitae diuturnitate ’,’ upon his epitaph. Had he
died in the lisetime of Augustus, general opinion would have pronounced
him ‘imperii capax! At the end of eight years’ rule he would have lest
aname among the best princes os the second rank. Even at seventy his
memory would have escaped the worst stains cast upon it. Yet, had he
lived up throughout to the level os his best time ς his want of originality
and sels-reuance, his pcdantic adherence to the ideas os his predecessor⁷,
would have made it no more than a period of good administration without
advance; and a mle which in duration is equalled by none till Antoninus
Pius, and exceeded by none till Constantine, would probably have been
barren os historical interest. To waive all oomparison with the great
names os Roman Imperialism, even a much weaker ruler, Claudius, has
lest his mark more on the history os the empire. Nor is a change of
character, even late in lise, in his case difficult to explain. At the best.
his virtues were those os the subject or subordinate ruler rather than of

· the autocrat3 and the principate found him timid, irresolute, and sels-

distrustl'ul, when he had no superior to rely upon. Hence the necessity '
always, 111 estimating his conduct, to allow sor the influence os some
