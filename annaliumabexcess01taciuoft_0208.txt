26. Responsum est a contione, mandata Clementi centur-{onus
quae perferret. is orditur de missione a sedecim annis, dea
praemiis finitae militiae, ut denarius diurnum stipendium foret,
ne veterani sub vexillo haberentur. ad ea Drusus cum arbitrium

5 senatus et patris obtenderet, clamore turbatur. cur venisset8
neque augendis militum stipendiis neque adlevandis laboribus,
denique nulla bene faciendi licentia? at hercule verbera et necem
cunctis permitti. Tiberium olim nomine Augusti desideria le-4
gionum frustrari solitum: easdem artes Drusum rettulisse. num· 5

10 quamne ad se nisi filios familiarum venturos? novum id plane
quod imperator sola militis commoda ad senatum reiciat. eundem 8
ergo senatum consulendum, quotiens supplicia aut proelia indi· ’

cantur: an praemia sub dominis, poenas sine arbitro esse?

which appears to be its meaning in c. 46,
2, etc. Here, however, the only question
thus reserved by Drusus is whether certain
concessions should be made or not (c. 26,
5). The suggestion below (c. 26. 6),
that is the senate be consulted on military
rewards it should also be consulted on
punishments, is thrown out by the soldiers
themselves, to show that they saw through
the pretext.

4. arbitrium . . . obtenderet, ‘was
pleading the authority;‘ i. e. that they
must decide on such requests. ‘-Ob
tendere‘ is osten thus used by Tacitus, as
also by Quint. and Pl. min„ in speaking
of a plea or pretext e. g. 3. ι,7 23 35,
2, etc.· . cp. the substantive ‘obtentui’
(c. 10, 1, etc.).

6. augendis. On this gerundive dative,
see Introd. v. ξ 22 b.

8. eunetis, a rhetorical exaggeration.
Even the centurion had his vine-rod (see
c. 23, 4); but capital punishment could
be inflicted on a soldier. in Caesarian
provinces, by no lower officer than the

‘legatus Augu sti; in senatorial pro-
vinces, not even by the proconsul. See
Dio. 53. 13, 6.

9. rettulisse, ‘had repeated? cp. 4.
4. 33 also ‘veterem Valeriae gentis.
laudem rettulisset’ (Cic. Flacc. 1, ι);
⁴ cum aditus consul idem illud responsum
⁴ rettulit’ (Liv. 37. 6, 7); ‘nota refert
meretricis acumina’ (Hor. Epp. 1. 17. 55)

numquamne ad se nisi. Nearly
all editors have followed Lipsius ιιι thus
transposing the MS. text ‘numquamne
nisi ad se: so also ‘adversum ferri'
(c. 65, 7) has been treated as an error of

transposition. This general agreement.
makes it needless to examine Walther's
explanation of the words as they stand in
the MS.‚ as an exaggeration put into the
mouth of the speaker, making the griev-
ance peculiar to themselves.

10. filios familiarum, i e. persons not

‘sui iuris.9 The incompetence to redreoe a
military grievance has no real connection
with the disabilities os a ‘filius- familias;'
which may be illustrated by the account
of Tiberius aster his adoption (Suet.
Tib. 15), ‘neque donavit neque mann· ·
misit, ne hereditatem quidem aut legata
percepit aliter, quam ut peculio referret
accepta.' The word is thus contemptuons
rather than relevant, and merely moens,
‘Are our rulers never themselves to
visit us? '

novum id plane. The main sti-ess
is laid upon ‘commoda ;’ but ⁸ militis' is
also emphatic in relation to ‘ imperator. '
That the senate could ιιι no way interfere
with military matters not specially re-
ferred to it, is plain from 6. ‚;1 and
such reference to it here as in c. 6, 5.
appears to be an evasive devolution of
responsibility. On the practice of Tibe·-
rius, see note on c. 52, 2.

13. sub dominis; this is used in-
vidiouslyff un ler des} otism.¹ Augustus
and Tiberius alike repudiate the title of

‘dominus' as an insult. See 2. 87, a:
Suet. Aug 53; Tib. 27.

sine arbitro, ‘wholly uncontrolled. ¹
The word is used os mere intervention,
as‘ Armenii sine arbitro relicti sunt' 15.
