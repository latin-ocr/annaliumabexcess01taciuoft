42 INTRODUCTION.

ademptae virilitatis 6. 31, 3. Such brachylogy is also found in Caesar
and Livy. Dr. § 72.

35. Such genitives as morum 1. 80, 2 ; flagitii 3. 20, 2 ; sui muneris
15. 52, 4 (Nipp. on 3. 20); also concise uses of the gen. of sort, as
Vannius gentis Quadorum 2. 63, 7 (where see Nipp.); may be taken as
qualitative, or may be referred to the class noted in § 32.

36. The emptical genitive of the ger-und is an idiom apparently
without real parallel in any other author. The only instances are in the
later books of the Annals : nec grave . . . retinendi 13. 26, 4 ; penitus in-
fixum erat. . . vitandi 15. 5, 3 ; maneat. . ‚potentiam . . ‚ostentandi 15. 21‚3.
The gerund qualifies the substantiva] notion of a burden (implied in

‘ grave ¹) or a custom (implied in ‘fixum’ or ‘maneat’). Dr. ξ 204, Kennedy
1 8 5.

37. 'l'he gerundivo genitive (see the corresponding dat. ξ 22 b) is
used more frequently by Tacitus than by any other writer, and, in its
most remarkable forms, is especially characteristic of the Annals (Wolffiin,
Phil. 25. 1 13). The usages may be thus classified :—

(ᾳ) In z'ts simplest jbrm, it is part osan ordinary defining genitive .· the
expressions ‘ oratores pacis ' and ‘ oratores pacis petendae ' being equiva-
lent (see Roby‚ Pref. lxvii).

(b) Thegerundive becomes a more essential partos the expression, and,
with the noun, has the force of a genitive of quality: as bellum abo-

lendae infamiae 1. 3, 6; pecunia omittendae delationis 6. 30, 1. Cp. 3.
27, 1, etc.

(c) The expression above might be used predicativetv with ‘ esse'
‚v expressed <Liv.) or implied (Sall. Jug. 88, 4), or with ‘videri,' as quae

{conciliandae misericordiae videbantur 11. 3, 1.

(d) The genitive qualzfies tlte whole sentence (Roby 1288), as Aegyptum
proficiscitur cognoscendae antiquitatis 2. 59, 1. Cp. 3. 9, 2 ; 41, 43 13.
11, 2, etc. This usage, though found in Terence, Sallust, and Velleius, is
distinctly Tacitean by reason of its comparative rarity both before and
after him. It may be best taken as a Graecism, like τὸ ληστικὸν καθήρει,
τοῦ τὰς προσόδους ,μᾶλλον ἰέναι αὐτῷ (Thuc. 1. 4). Wolfflin would supply
the idea of a substantive, as ‘proficiscitur‚ quod (sc. proficisci) cogno-

, scendae antiquitatis erat! ‘Nipp. (on 2. 59) gives, from Em. Hoffmann,

a somewhat different classification of these usages. The gerundial gen.
is rarely thus used, as in 3. 27, 2.
