2. ceterum. cp. c. 10, 1.

3. fastigium, used of‘ rank: by Livy
and later authors. When the highest
rank' is spoken of, as here, an adjective· is
usually added; but cp. ‘initia fastigii' 3.
29, 2; and‘ stare in fastigio eloquentiae’
Quint. 12.1‚ 20.

in. This hardly expresses here result,
as in c. 11, 4, etc.· , but rather how an act
or event is interpreted, as in 6. 13, 4 ; 1 2.
43, 2 ; 16. 18, 2 : cp. ‘ in omen acceptum ’
Liv. 21. 63, 14.

ne lictorem quidem.
from Dio (56. 46. 2) that she had a
lictor when in performance of her duties
as priestess of Augustus. Two were
assigned to Agrippina, as ‘flaminica
Claudialis’ (13. 2, 6).

4. aram adoptionis. Altars are often
erected as monuments, without implying
any act of worship. Thus we have ‘ ara
ob Agrippinae puerperium' (Suet. Cal.
8); and altars to personifications, as
‘ultionis ’ (3. 18, 3); ‘clementiae,‘ ‘ami-
citiae’ (4. 74, 3).

5. proconsulare imperium. Some
renewal or extension must be understood

It appears

. of that which he had received in 764,

Α. D. 11, and must have been still holding,
as an ‘ imperium maius ' in Gaul and
Germany. That he was not fully ‘ collega
imperii’ with Tiberius is implied in 2

43, 2. See Introd. vi. p. 833 Momms.

Staatsr. ii. p. 1094, etc.
7. solarentur. On the frequent poetical

·use in Tacitus of simple for compound

vedis, see Introd. v. § 40.

8. quod designatus consul, etc. The
explanation appears to be, tha't such an
‘imperium,’ valid only‘ extra urbem'

(12. 41, 2), would not be suitable to one

who was to hold an urban magis
Nipp. and Mommsen (Staatsr. ii. 1095, 2)
think that the allusion to his presence
points to the delicacy of his having him-
self to give the first vote. This, however,

*¹²07-

appears not to hold in a ‘ relatio Caesaris ' .

(3. 17, 8); and, in any other ‘relatio,'
might be obviated (3. 22, 6). Drusus, ιιο
doubt, had this imperium when sent to
Illyricum (2. 44, 1).

number twelve was occasiona y exceeded
both by Augustus (Dio, 56. 25, 4) and
by Tiberius (2. 32, 1; Dio, 58. 20, 5);
but is retained as the normal number.
See 2. 36, 1; Momms Staatsr. ii. p. 880.

10. obstrinxit. This verb is used abso-

Tacitus has‘ clementiam suam obstrin-

of these praetors. The first consular
elections are spoken ofin c. 81. It is
implied in the context, and in Vell. 2.
126, 2, that the change obtained hence·

change, see Introd. vi. p. 75; Mommsen,
Staatsr ii. p. 87 s etc.

13. adeam diem. Augustus. is stated,
aster the restoration of the comitia (Suet.
Aug. 40), to have superseded them in
cases of exceptional turbulenee (Dio, 54.

of ordinary canvassing is seen from the
description of Horace, Epp. 1. 6, 49, etc.

to the choice of consuls, which however
