CORNELII TACITI ANNALIUM [A.U.C. 7⁷⁸·

noscenda vulgi natura et quibus modis temperanter habere-
tur, senatusque et optimatium ingenia qui maxime perdi·
dicerant, callidi temporum et sapientes credebantur, sic converso
statu neque alia re Romana quarn si unus imperitet, haec con-
5 quiri tradique in rem fuerit, quia pauci prudentia honesta 'ab
deterioribus, utilia ab noxiis discernunt, plures aliorum eventis

docentur.
adferunt.

ceterum ut profutura, ita minimum oblectationis 8
nam situs gentium, varietates proeliorum, clari ducum

exitus retinent ac redintegrant legentium animum : nos saeva
ιο iussa, continuas accusationes, fal-laces amicitias, perniciem inno-
centium et easdem exitu causas coniungimus, obvia rerum simili-

tudine et satietate.

1. noscenda vulgi natura. This is
best taken as nom„ with ‘ erat' supplied,
and ‘noscendum’ again supplied with
‘ quibus . . . haberetur : ’ cp. ‘ decreta pe-
cunia . . . utque’ 1. 15, 4.

temperanter haberetur, ‘ might be
discreetly controlled.' On the use of
‘ haberi,' cp. 1. 54, 4, etc.

2. senatusque, etc. This sentence
answers to ‘ cum patres pollerent‚' as the
one before it to ‘ plebe valida ; ’ the form
of expression being as is the former sen-
tence had run ‘ qui . . . cognoverant,’ etc.

3. callidi temporum: such a con-
struction occurs in H. 2. 31, 4; also in
Colum. 2. 2, 1, etc.: cp.1ntrod. v. ξ 33 e, α.

4. neque alia, etc„ ‘bein a virtual
monarchy.’ The constitution under the
pri'n—cipate was not formally monarchical :
see Introd. vi. pp. 81-83.

haec, i. e. ‘quae rettuli quaeque re·
seram ;' such small occurrences, illus-
trating the character of the pn'nceps and
the senate.

5. in rem fuerit, ‘may have been
useful! ⁸ In rem’ is thus used in H. 3.
8, 1, and often in Plaut., Sall., Liv.‚ etc.
The utility of history as a political guide
is similarly described in Thuc. 1. 22, 4.

6. eventis, ⁶ the experienees.’ The
word occurs here alone in Tacitus; but
Cic. thus uses ⁴ eventa nostra’ (Fam. 1. 7,

and ‘alterius' (Tusc. 5. 12,
. . pro-

93 5. 12, 6) . Ι
36): cp. ‘ex aliorum eventis .

videre’ (Auct. ad Her. 4. 9, 13).

7. ut . . . ita: cp. 1, 12, 1; 42, 53
³· §figi-iernen, ‘ vicissitudes :’ so ‘ van'e-
tates annonae' (Liv. 7. 31, 1).

9. exitus, ‘deaths;' asin 1. 10, 2,ete.

redintegrant, ‘retreshz’ cp. ⁴ co-

tum quod antiquis scriptoribus rarus obtrec- 4

{mbae . . ὃ ae're redintegrentur’ (Varr.

11. easdem exitu causas. Halm here >
retains the MS. text, which must be taken
to mean ‘ causas eundem exitum habentes:
i.e. ‘always resulting in condemnation?
The statement, though an exaggeration
of the facts, would agree with that in
c. 28, ²3 but the construction is harsh, ‘
and there is much to be said sor the
emendation of Pichena, adopted by Ritt„ ‚
Orelli, and Nipp., and advomted by
Heraus, ‘easdem exitii causas! Thte
expression would be Tacitean (cp. c. 52,
5; 58, 2, ete), and the sameness heoe
referred to would be the constant jeaiousy,
sear, or avarice of princes.

conjungimus, ‘ string together? The
verb is somewhat similarly used of
narrating events continuously in 6. 38, 1;
12. 40, 83 13, 9. 6.

obvia, ‘ forcing itself upon notice.'
Nipp. compares ⁸ obvia ostentatione’ γ
(Pl. Epp. 1. 8, 17).

12. tum quod. The explanation of thiu ’
passage by Joh. Miiller (Beitr. sect. 3, >
pp. 46-51) is now adopted by Nipp.;
namely, that this clause must be referred
back to the beginning of the digression ’
in c. 32 z one of the causes why this work ²
is not to be compared to those of the ’ἴῖ
old historians having there been given
(‘ ingentia illi bella . . . incuriosus emt’); g.
the second being here introduced, but ,ᾗ
with an anacoluthon, as if the former «ζ
passage had begun ‘primum quod in- ’Ξ
gentia,’ ete. But it seems on the whole J·
less difficult to understand ‘tum quod'
(==‘huc accedit quod ') with Doed. a:
giving another reason for ‘ minimum ψ
oblectationis adferunt.’ His book will
