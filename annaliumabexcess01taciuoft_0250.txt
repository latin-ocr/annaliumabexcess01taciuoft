lam. This passage identifies one of the
legions lost with Varus. See Introd. vii.
p. 103. Respecting the recovery of other
eagles see on 2. 25, ²3 41, 1. ,
ductum inde agmen, etc. Pfitzner
(p. 89) supposes the soree of Stertinius
alone to be here meant, and that Ger-
manicus with the main body moved up
the right bank of the Ems, entering the
Osning district (see next note) from the
north. But the whole passage seems to
show that the ‘agmen' is the army, and
the force of Stertinius only its advanced
guard. This district between the Ems
and Lippe, i. e. Westphalia between
Miinster and Paderborn, will thus appear
to have been reached by a most circuitous
route; and the German military criticism‚
cited by Pfitzner, that no adequate stra-
tegic advantage from the sea-voyage is
perceptible‚ seems sully justified.

cality, which must have spread over con-
siderable space, as the final catastrophe
took place on the fourth day of the re-
treat. The marshy tract between Beckum
and the Lippe, preferred by Nipp. on the
ground of its suitability to the descrip-
tion, appears to lie too far west, and too
near to the country known to the Romans.
The district generally identified with this

ι forest is the Osning, extending, near the

sources of the Ems and Lippe, between
Paderbom and Osnaburg; and Varus is
supposed to have been in retreat from the
Weser by way of Herford or Detmold.

pontes et aggerem these are coupled
again in 4. 73, 2. On the former, see
note on c. 63, 63 the latter appear here,-

structed by embankment.

9. maestos looos; such an application ·

of ⁶ maestus ' is frequent in poetry. Taci-
tus uses another such figure (‘ tacentes
loci') in H. 3. 84, 6. The plural ‘loci‚'
used rather of distinct spots than of local·
ities (cp. 13. 36, 1), is rare, but in Sall.
and Liv. as well as in poets.

visu, ‘the actual appearanee‚‘ as
opposed to the associations (‘ memoria ”).

prima . . . eastra. It is noticed
that the order of description follows that
of the retreat os Varus. This may prob-
ably have been adopted sor pictorial
effect; as the advance of Germanicus
would naturally be in the reverse direc-
tion (see note on e. 60, 5), and it is hardly
possible to suppose, as Nipp. suggests,
that he altered his route. so as to follow
the events in their order. Details of the
march and encampments of Varus are
given in Dio, 56. 20-22; but some part
of his narrative, occupying at least a page
of MS„ is lost.

10. principiis, ‘the headquarters: or
central space, from the measurement of
which that of the whole camp was taken,
containing the ‘praetorium, ‘augurale’
etc.. and sufficient space to collect the
troops for an address (c. 67, 1, etc.). This
camp, besides having a wide circuit (⁶1ato
ambitu')‚ had this space regularly marked
out, on a scale suitable to the whole
force.
