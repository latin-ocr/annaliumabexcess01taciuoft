tans3’ and appears undoubtedly to have
taken bribes from Jugurtha.

1·. dehonestabat. The verb is first
found 'm Liv. 41, 6. Tacitus uses it only
in the Annals‚ e. g. c. 70, 4, ete.

2. literarium ludum, ‘ an elementary
school :‘ so in Plin. (N. H. 9. 8, 8, 25),
etc. He would seem to have had more
talent than is here implied; as M. Seneca
speaks of him in several places, as an ac-
complished though artificial speaker, and
as an author of rhetorical works (Con-
trOV. 9. 33, 37). Similar instances of men
of low birth rising to great wealth and
rank by the profession of rhetoric and
practice of delation are found in Eprius
Marcellus and Vibius Crispus (see Dial.

8, 3).

4. ausis: cp. 2. 39, 3.
propolluebat. Halm and Orelli

here retain the MS. text, for which very
many alterations have been suggested:
see their comm. critt. Is the text is sound,
we must suppose that Tacitus, who has
elsewhere (6. 25, 1) eoined‘ provixiss se‚’
in the sense of‘ lived on, ’has here treated
‘polluo‘ as a simple verb, and formed
this compound of it, in the sense of ‘ was
yet further defiling.¹ ’ The simplest emen-
dation, ‘polluebat‚‘ is perhaps the most
satisfactory, and not tautologous, as his
‘obscura initia' are not to be presumed
to be therefore already ‘polluta. ’
Bruttedium. This person also is
cited by M. Seneca as an orator (Contr.
9. 35) aynd historical writer (Suas. 6. 20,
21). It would appear from Juvenal (ιο,

82, where see Ma yor) that he was in-
volved ιιι the fall of Seianus.

copiosum, ‘richly endowed? cp.

‘copiosa vita' 13. 43, 7.

5. pergeret, with accus„ as in 1. 28,
2; 4. 20, ,etc. This reading is adopted
by all editors for the MS. ‘perageret'
which would im pyl a course comp leted
at the close of life (cp. Verg. Aen. 4, p653).
and would thus give a sense inconsistent
with ⁴ iturum?

6. suasmet, i.e. all that he had for-
merly hoped for.

10. Gellius Publicola, Borghesi con·
siders this person, who was cos. suff. in
793, A. D. 40, to have been desoeuded
