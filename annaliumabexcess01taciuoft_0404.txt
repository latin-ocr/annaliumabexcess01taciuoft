This would be, as is here stated, a partial

any alteration of the law itself.

3. vigintiviratus. On the separate
magistracies thus collectively designated‚

526, o .

4. per leges. The old ‘lex Villia
Annalis’ of 574, B.C. 180 (Liv. 40. 44, 1),
had now been modificd, probably by Au-
gustus. Tiberius, who is here stated to
have himself had only the same privilege
as that which he requests, was quaestor in
his nineteenth year (Veli. 2. 94, 1). Mae-
cenas is represented (Dio, 52. 20, Ι) as
recommending twenty-five as the earliest
age for a senator. It would thus appear
that the twenty-fourth or twenty-fifth year
was at this time the earliest legal or cus-
tomary age for the quaestorship.

which could not be refused was a mock-

7. ιβ tamen, i. e. yet such a request
was not then so ludicrous sor a refusal
was not so out of the question. Three
reasons are given for this difference.

73, 3; 6. 32, 1, etc.

9. levior necessitudo, ‘the tie ofcon-
nexion was slighter.’ Thence it might be
supposed that Augustus cared less about
the request than Tiberius.
