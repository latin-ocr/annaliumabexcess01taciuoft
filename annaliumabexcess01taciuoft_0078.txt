(8) Contrast between what is shown and concealed: palam

94. 'I'he monotony of reported speeehes in oratio obliqua is
often varied (as also not unfrequently in Liv.) by an abrupt transition
to oratio recta, as 2. 77, 23 3.12, 43 46. 3; 4. 40, 55 H. 3. 2, 8.
The transition has also the effect of a rhetorical climax (Dr. § 256). On
smaller parenthetica] suspensions of oratio obliqua, see ξ 49.

IV. Influence of Imz'tatz‘on.

95. Graecisms. Nearly all of those found in Tacitus appear to have been
already more or less naturalised in Latin. Most of them have been already
noticed (see ἕξ 11, 12 d, 13, 16, 18, 37 d, 54, 60 b, 66, 67). To these
may be added the use of si with expressions of sear, etc„ as 1. 11, 5 ;
such a genitive as diversa omnium 1. 49. 1 ; the construction nisi forte . . .
plures curas, etc. 2. 33, 5; and the phrase ut quisque audentiae habuisset
15. 53, 3. The list of Greek words used by him (see Nipp. on 14. 15, 6)
is not large, and, consists wholly of terms more or less technical, and
which have no strict Latin equivalent. Dr. ἐξ 67, 147, 191, 258.

96. Latin archaisms. The desire of novelty in diction appears to
have led Tacitus sometimes to revive obsolete words and forms from old
writers, in preference to employing those which were usual (Wolfflin,
Philol. 25, 106, etc.). Among such may be noticed dissertare 12. 11, 1
(Cato and Plaut.); mercimonium 15. 38, 2 (Plaut.),· perduellis 14. 29, 2
