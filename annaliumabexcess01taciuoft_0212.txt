si supplices audiat, scripturum patri ut placatus legionum preces

1. orto die. Only one day and night
had passed since he entered the camp (c.
25,1). On the whole time covered by
these events see on c.16,1.

2. nobilitate. This word has here
something of a moral sense like that of
γενναιότης, ‘generosity.‘ It appears also
to have a similar though less definite
sense in H. 1. 30, 1 ‘nihil adrogabo mihi
nobilitatis aut modestiae ’

3. terrore et minis. Here, as in
‘nihil. .prisci etintegri' (c.4, 1), and
other uses of‘ et' in negative clauses, the
words are more closely coupled than if

‘nec ’had been used

5. exciperet. This imperfect appears
to be rightly explained by Walther as
used to denote a more uncertain conse-
quence. ‘Excipiat ' would have implied
a tone of authority.

orantibus, ‘on their petition‚' i.e.
that he would so write. On this abl.
abs, see Introd. v. ξ 31 c.

idem Blaesus : see c. 19, 4.

12.A1)roniu8. The original text of
the MS. has ‘ Aponius,' which N ipp. re-
tains, thinking the description here given
of the person more suitable to a less
known name (cp. H. 1. 79, 8‚·etc.) than
to that os a consular family such as the
Apronii (see c.56, 1, etc.). Those who
identify him with the Apronius Caesianus
of 3. 21, 6 would suppose him to be now

The idea of such a ‘cohors amicorum‘
attending the princeps or members of his

family in travel‚ appears to be derived
from the‘ cohors praetoria' or staff os a
provincial governor under the rep ublic
(Cic. Verr. 2. 1, 14, 36, etc..) SeeFried· ι

Iustus Catonius. This is p-roba
bly the same person who was afterwards

60. 18, 3). On· primi ordinis centurio:
see Introd. vii. p. 105.

8. opperiendos legatos, i. e. that no
punishergent should be inflicted till they
return

11. ex duee metus.'1'he phrase‘ me-
tus ex aliquo? even without a verb, is
frequentin Tacitus (e. g. 2. 38. 6· 72, 2·
3. 65 ,1, etc.,) and appears grounded'on such
expressions in Livy as iraexelade' (2. 51,
6), and‘ luctus: ‘ssdolor etc.‚ ‘exrealiquaf

12. promptum ad sapei-iota. On the
temperament of Drusus. see c. 76, 5: 4.
3, 2. Dio (57. 13, 1) calls him ἀσελγέσ·
τατος καὶ ὠμότατος, exaggerating the worst
side os the passionate but generous nature
ascribed to him by Tacitus, and ap g
to the slight evidence that the
swords were called from him Δρονσίανα.

14 obrutosu were hastily buriedz' cp'.

‘cadaver levi cespite obrutum est’ (Suet.
Cal. 59). This version of the story is adop·
ted by Dio (57. 4, 5), who gives no other.

15. ostentui, ‘to point the lesson?
On this dative, see Introd. v. ξ 23 This
word had been already thus used by
Sallust (Jug 24‚10;46.6)‚but with
somewhat different meaning.
