1. Taurum. On Statilius Taurus, cp.
6. 11, 6. His amphitheatre‚ the first, and,
till the Flavian era, the only one of stone,
was in the Campus Martius, and was
dedicated by him in 724, Β. c. 30 (Dio,
51.t12;3,ff). Iit· i} supposed to have perished

Philippum. L. Marcius Philippus,
son of the stepfather of Augustus, was
trib. pl. in 705, 13.C. 49 (Caes. B. C. 1. 6,
4), praetor in 710, B. C. 44 (Cic. Phil. 3.
10, 2 5). Borghesi also shows that he was
cos. suff. in 716, Β. c. 38, and gained a
triumph from Spain. His ‘aedes Her-
culis Musarum’ (Suet. l. l.)‚ the ‘clari
monumenta Philippi' of Ovid (Fast. 6,

Nobilior.

Balbum. L. Cornelius P. f. Balbus,
a consular of the famous Spanish family,
had gained a triumph (for successes as
proconsul in Africa in 735, B.c. 19) and
3333&ssssss (Xnssssrti‘nff’thssne‘issaseHfff
Pompeius and Marcellus, stood in the
Campus Martius, near the river, and was
dedicated) by him in 741, B. C. 13 (Dio,

4h02tiles exuvias; so ‘bellorum ex-
uviae' Juv. 10, 133: here for the general’s
prize-money (⁸ manubiae ’).

2. ornatum adurbis. 'On the ana-
strophe, see Introd. v. § 77, 4.

3. pecuniae modicus. On the gen„
ep. 2. 73, 3; on the probable reason sor
the fact, see c. 32, 2.

avitum decus: see note above, ξ 1,
and the suu account os his lineage given
by Nipp. from Borghesi.

4. recoluit, ‘ renewed : ’ so used of
images replaced (H. 3. 7, 3), or of persons

reinvested with dignities (H. 1. 77, 5).

Pompei theatrum: see on c. 23, 1.
The stage alone was destroyed, and Ti-
berius, if he completed the restoration,
left the dedication to Gaius (see 6. 45, 3,
and note there).

haustum, thus metaphorieally ap-
plied to destruction by fire in 12. 58, 2 3
H. 4. 60, 53 Liv. 5. 7, 3, etc.

5. extructurum. On the omission of
‘se,’ cp. Introd. v. ς 8. ·

nemo e familis.. The only Pom-
peius known at this time, and apparently
the last of that house (see 1. 7, 3, eta),
must be supposed to have been poorz
Nipp. notes that, in a passage cited as
proving the opposite to this (Sen. Tranq.
An. 1 1. 8, 10), ‘Ptolemaeo’ should be read
for ‘ Pompeio.‘

6. restaurando sufficeret. ‘Sufficere’
is thus used with gerundial dat. (cp.
Introd. v. ξ 22 a) in Liv. 26. 36: for a
similar use with the gerundum, cp. 4. 23,
13 6. 4, 4; Agr. 45, 2.

7. tamquam, ‘ on the ground (or plen)
that? The expression does not neoes-
sarily insinuate the falsehood of what is·
alleged, which certainly in some instances ’-
(cp. 4. 31, 75 11.4,3; H. 148, 5, etc.)seems ‘³
implied to be true. See Introd. v. 5 67, -’
and several passages cited here by Nipp. ’

8. intra . . . stetisset, ‘had not gone 2
beyond2’ cp. c. 75, 4; 4. 7, 1, ‘citra
stetit' 12. 22, 3, ‘sistere intm’ 4. 40, 7, ²
also ‘utinam . . . intra verba peccasset’ '
Curt. 7. 1, 26. ζ

9. apud theatrum=‘in theatro’(1n· ”
trod. v. 5 57). Seneca (Cous. ad Mare. “
22, 4) quotes an exclamation of Cremutius *
Cordus (see 4. 34, 1) on hearing os this >
decree, ‘tunc vere theatrum perire? It
would seem that the statue was at once ἢ
ereeted: cp. 4. 7, 3.

10. Blaesum: see c. 35, 1, etc.
