2. Rhescuporim. The orthography
of this> name varies even on coins, and
still more so in the MSS. of various
authors: see Lips. and Walther.

Thraeciae. On the form, cp. c. 54,
2. In Roman times the boundary be-
tween this country and Macedonia was
the Nestus (Karasu). Thrace had been
fully subject to Rome for some time, the
last rising having been crushed in 743,
B.c. 11 <see note on 6. 10, 4), but re-
mained under native princes until Claud ius
made it a province in 799, A. D. 46: see
Marquardt, Staatsv. i. p. 156, and a dis-
sertation on this dynasty by Mommsen
(Eph. Epig. ii. pp. 2 50. 263).

3. Rhoemetalces,the first os that name,
son ofSadala andPolemocratia (Momms.).
He bears the head of Augustus on the
obverse of his coins, in token of suzerainty,
and his own on the reverse only, a
practice followed by others of this
dynasty: see Mr. Donne, in Dict. ,os
Biog. Mommsen (1.1. p. 254) dates his
death about 765, A.D. 12, before the
composition of Ov. ex P. 2. 9.
¹ 5. arva et urbes, i.e. the south-eastern

art.

p 6. adnexum, Drager notes that this
word is nowhere else used in the sense of
‘vicinum.’ for which it* is here‘a mere
variation. The ‘hostes’ would be the
wild and unsubdued tribes of the Balkan:
see 3. 38, 5 ; 4. 46, 1.

7. ingenia . . . erat. The sentence
appears to be so condensed as to have no

γ construction; the sense being that their

temperament answered to the nature of

the country under their mle, the one being
gentle, the other fierce: see note on 1.
8, 5³ 6· 48. 7- ,

mite et amoenum: so ‘ ingenium
amoenum,’ used os Seneca (13. 3, 2); the
sense being that of ‘ attractiveness!
Ovid, who addroeses Cotys as a brother
poet (ex P. 2. 9), calls him ‘iuvenum
mitissime' (ν. 19).

8. societatis,
power?

9. vertere in se, ‘ appropriatos τ’ so
‘occasio in se unum vertendae gloriae’
(Liv. 21. 53, 6) : cp. ‘ trahere in se ’ (1. 2,
1, etc.).

12. enimvero. Hildebrand (on Apul.
Met. 4. 12, 263) cites this as an adversa-
tive use of the word, and Drager here
notes that such use is confined to Tacitus,
Florus (2. 7, 10), and Apuleius. Among
the twelve instanoes of this word in
Tacitus (see Gerber and Greef, Lex.)‚ this
does perhaps approach nearest to an ad-
versative use ; but really here,as elsewhere
(e. g. 1. 17, 6: 4. 60, 33 6. ²5·.².³ 35, 1;
12. 64, 6), rt marks the transxuon from
the less to the more important: Rhes-

cuporis, who had been timidly aggressive κ

in the lifetime of Augustus, now becomes
boldly and openly so: see Zumpt, Gr.

⁴348, note3 Hand, Turs. ii. 407.

. inmittere latronum globos, repeated
in 12. 54, 4.

13. causas bello. On the apposition,
cp. 1. 27, 1, etc.; Introd. v. § 12 a.

14. anxium habebat: cp. c. 57, 1.

conposita, ‘a settlement, such asthat
made by Augustus : cp. c. 57, 1.
