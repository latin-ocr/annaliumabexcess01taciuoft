248 CORNELII TACITI ANNALIUM [A.U.C. 768.

celebrem miseriae temporum et audaciae hominum fecerunt. nam 2
egens, ignotus, inquies, dum occultis libellis saevitiae principis
adrepit, mox clarissimo cuique periculum facessit, potentiam apud
unum, odium apud 'omnis adeptus dedit exemplum, quod secuti

5 ex pauperibus divites, ex contemptis metuendi perniciem aliis ac
postremum sibi invenere. sed Marcellum insimulabat sinistrosa
de Tiberio sermones habuisse, inevitabile crimen, cum ex moribus
principis foedissima quaeque deligeret accusator obiectaretque
reo. nam quia vera erant, etiam dicta credebantur. addidit4

10 Hispo statuam Marcelli altius quam Caesarum sitam, et alia in
statua amputato capite Augusti effigiem Tiberii inditam. ad5
quod exarsit adeo, ut rupta taciturnitate proclamaret se quoque
in ea causa laturum sententiam palam et iuratum, quo ceteris
eadem necessitas fieret. manebant etiam tum vestigia morientis 6

15 libertatis. igitur Cn. Piso ‘ quo' inquit ‘ loco censebis, Caesar?

(cp. Cic. ad Q. F. 3. 3, 2; Veli. 2. 69, 5 ς
and ⁶ subscriptor,' ‘ subscriptio ' Cic. Div.

9. quja vera, etc.. ⁴ their truth would
stand for evidence of their utterance.‘

in Caec. 15. 47, 49), denotes that he ap-
-peared as subordinate to CrispinuS.

Romano Hispone. M. Seneca, who
gives his name as ‘ Hispo Romanius?
mentions him osten, and in one place
(Contr. 26, 17) says of him ‘ erat na-
tura qui asperiorem dicendi viam seque-
retur?

qui formam, etc. This probably re-
fers-to Hispo, who, besides being nearest
in order of mention, is known, if not as a
professional informer, at least as a pro-
sessional rhetorician (see above) ; and
who is more likely to be ‘ egens ’ and ⁸ ig-
notus) than a quaestor, who was presum-
ably a senator. But it is difficult, aster so
long a parenthesis, to take ‘ Crispinus ' to
be the subject of ‘insimulabat ; ‘ and also
difficult to refer this verb to Hispo, whose
separate charge is specified below, There
is therefore much to be said sor Nipp.'s
reading ⁸ insimulabant: which makes this
part their joint charge.

1. miseriae . . . audaciae. On such

lurals of abstract nouns in Tacitus. see

ljntmd. v. ξ 1 3 and a fuller list in Dr‘ager
Synt. und Stil, 5 2. , ,

3. adr-epit.. The dative with this verb
gip. 3350, 5) is otherwise only used by

. mal.

6. postremum sibi: see 4. 71, r, etc.

sod. used to mark a retum from a
digression, as in 3. 62, 3 ; 63, 5, etc.

8. obiectaretque reo, ‘and charged
the accused with mentioning them?

10. sitam = ⁶ positam ε ’ cp. c. 39, 4.

11. amputato, etc. The destruction of ⁴

a statue was a significant act (cp. 3. 14, ὗς
Juv. 10, 58) ; but adaptation of new heads
was common in Pliny's time, who says
(N. H. 35. 2, 4) ‘surdo figurarum discri-
mine statuarum capita permutantur-²

inditam. This verb, generally used
with dat.. or ‘ in ¹ and aec., here alone has
an abl. with ⁸ in.’

13. palam et iuratum. The former
word is in contrast to voting ‘ per disces-
sionem.' the latter iinplies such a formula
as that in 4. 31, 5 ⁴ ut iureiurando obstrin-
geret, e republica id esse? Cp. c. 14, 6.
and ‘iudicio iurati senatus' 4. 21, 5 ς also
Liv. 30. 40, 12.

quo . . . fieret. The explanation is
that of the historian, and the ⁶ necessitas'
meantstils that of also voting openly and
on oa .

14. vestigia morientis libertatis. On
the personifications in Tacitus, see on c.
70, 7. For the figure ‘manent vestigia’
cp. 15. 42, 4 ; H. 5. 7, 1; and ‘manebat
imago reipublicae ¹ 13. 28, 1. The figun-
tive use of ‘ morior’ is Ciceronian, but
hardly appropriate to the metaphor here.

15. On. Piso: see on c. 13, 3, etc.

quo . . .loeo. On the usual custom os the
princeps, to vote first or last. see Introd.
vi. p. 71. Dio ( 37. 7, 4) describes Tiberius
as interposing his ⁴ sententia) also at other
stages, or sometimes informally intimat-
ing his opinion.
