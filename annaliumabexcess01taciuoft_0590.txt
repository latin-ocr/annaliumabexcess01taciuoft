CORNELII TACITI ANNALIUM [A.U.C. 786.

congruere rebus putant, sed non e vagis stellis, verum apud prin-
cipia et nexus naturalium causarum 3 ac tamen electionem vitae
nobis relinquunt, quam ubi elegeris, certum imminentium ordinem.

opes miserrimos, si illi gravem fortunam constanter tolerent, hi

ancl ‘a fortiori ' gods, do not change their
will for entreaties: ‘prima lex est, stare
decreto’ (Id. 35, 2). In another place
(de Ben. 4. 7, 2) he still more clearly
identifies sate or ‘natura' with God:
‘hunc eundern (Deum) et fatum si dixeris
non mentieris. Nam cum fatum nihil
aliud sit quam series implexa causarum,
ille est prima omnium causa unde ceterae
pendent.’

fatum . . . congruere rebus, ‘that
sate is in accord with things;’ i.e. that
things go in accordance with· fate3 an in-
version similar to that in ‘ignaviam . . .
transferri‘ (3. 34, 7). ‘Congruere’ is thus
used of harmony between things in 12. 6,
23 13. 50, 3, etc. Nipp. here reads ‘in-
gruere,' comparing ‘necessitas ingrueret’
(c. 10, 3), ‘ingruente fato’ (Liv. 5. 32,
7), ‘ vim, quae de fato extrinsecus in-
gruit’ (Chrysippj ap. Gen. 7 (6), 2, 8):
but such an expression seems here to be
harsher than the MS. text.

1. sed non, etc„ equivalent to ‘sed
fatum non e stellis pendere, verum esse
eius regimen apud principia,’ etc. ‘ Prin-
cipia et nexus ‘ = ‘ the foundations and se-
quences of natural causation.’ With this
may be compared the definitions given
above from Seneca: also Diog. Laert.
(7. 74. 149) καθ’ εἱμαρμένην δέ φασι τὰ
πάντα γίγνεσθαι· -ἔστι δὲ εἱμαρμένη αἰτία,
τῶν ὄντων εἰρομένη, ἦ λόγος καθ’ ὃν ὅ κοσ-
μὸς διεξάγεταιε and the doctrine of Chry-
sippuS, as stated in his own words, and
explained in Gen. 7 (6), 2. It would
appear, however, that some Stoics‚ as
Diogenes (Cic. Div. 2. 43, 90), recognised
planetary influences as a factor in causa-
tion; and that most others, except Pan-
aetius (Id. 42, 88), admitted astrology in
some form as a branch of divination,
whereby indications of the will of heaven

might be ascertained. See Zeller, ⁸ stoioe:
etc. (transl. by Reichel) p. 349, soll.

2. ae tamen, etc„ i.e. yet they leave
us free to choose a course os lise, which
choice, once made, carries with it a fixed
train of consequences. A form of this
doctrine is suggested by the myth in Plat.
Rep. 10. 617 E, sqq. It is doubtful whe-
ther the saving clause here mentioned was
really a Stoic tenet3 but various attempts ’
to reconcile free willand satewere genera ly
made by them: see Gell. 1. l.‚ Plut. R ugn.
Stoic. 47 ς and other authorities col ected
by Zeller (Reichel‚ pp. 168, foll.. 204, 205).

‘ per‚’ see Introd. v. 5 62.

7. ceterum plurimis, etc. The
pular belief is here contrasted with that
of the two leading schools. This state-
ment is carried down to ‘ tulerit.³

tence supplies the subject of ‘ non eximi-

also H. 1. 22, ις and the use of ‘talis
