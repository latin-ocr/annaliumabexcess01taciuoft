selling justice5 and the later history of the man is admitted to have
shown that compassion was undeserved¹. Nor will any regret the
punishment of informers for salse or vexatious charges ⁹. Three again

are acquitted ⁸, another saved by indefinite adjournment ⁴, another par· Α

doned amidst genuine applause ⁶, in another case the gravest part of
the charge is allowed to drop ⁸, in another expulsion from the senate is
the only penalty ⁷.

Granting however that the numerical list shrinks thus considerably on
investigatiom many oeses will still remain showing an increased sensitive-
ness to libels and vindictiveness in punishing them. Charges of this
kind, if not, in the former case, actually entering into the indictment, help
to bring about the downsall of Silius· and L. Piso’; it is for these that
Votienus is condemned to exile ¹⁰, and , that Cassius Severus, an old

, offender ¹¹, has his punishment increased ¹¹. By a further stretch, the law

is made to reach Cremutius Cordus for a work which, according to one

’ account, was of old standing and had even been recited before Augustus ¹⁸,

and sor a mere passage in which the eulogy was awarded to Cassius
which bad once been spoken over him by Brutus ¹⁴. We are assured
that the whole circumstances os the trial lest the accused no prospect of
escaping condemnation but by suicide.

Sometimes again conviction is alleged to have been ensorced where
proof was wanting; as in the trial of old Serenus on charges of con-
spiracy preferred by his son; charges which were certainly dismissed as
absurd in respect to some os the persons implicated in them, and on
which the evidence is stated to have altogether broken down ¹⁸. Yet
Caesar ia represented as insisting upon a condemnatory vote, though

ἱ interposing to modisy the proposed penalty οῖ death or stn'cter banish·
Ξ ment ¹⁸, satisfied apparently with the conviction itself.

Lastly, at the close os this period, in the case οἱ Titius Sabinus we are

³ informed of disgraceful expedients to procure evidence ¹², of a hurried
J vote and immediate execution without trial, on the very opening festival
Α of the new year, in obedience to a missive from the prince ¹⁸. There may
bave been more in the caae than is reported¹⁰, but the ominous beginning
j of the terrible letters from Capreae must be noted here.

Intormen again appear to be more openly encouraged, protected from

' just retribution in case os salachood '⁰, and securcd os their reward, even
