names in c. 51, 5.

‘alae’ The auxiliary troops generally

c. 3 ‚ 2.

modestia, ‘ subordination ;' as c. 35, 1.

1. agitabant=‘ degebant:' so 4. 46, 1 ;
11. 21, 2, etc.: cp. ‘ agere’ c. 68, 1, etc.

iustitio. See c. 16, 2.

3. Caesiam. This forest is nowhere else
mentioned ς but must have been near the
point of crossing, which must have been
between Xanten and ΚόῙη, probably nearer
to the former. Some think the name trace-
able in Coesfeld,where a hi h tract extends
from the Lippe to the {seh Another
view, more suitable to the probable line
of march here, agreeing with Lips„ that
the name should probably be ‘ Haesiam '
(connected with that of the German
war-god), traces it in a formerly existing
‘ Heserwald‚' the name of which survives
in the village of Heisingen, near Essen.

limitem ; this, as well as those
mentioned in 2. 7, 5, appear to have no
connection with the well-known ‘limes
Romanus ² of later date (Introd. vii. p. 93).
The direction of this one may probably
be inferred from the position of ‘Aliso’

. (2. 7, 5), westward of Hamm; which is

believed to have been one of the forts
securing it. Dorsten is supposed also to
be on the line of it (Ritter).

coeptum, ‘laid out.’ So ‘(h0rtos)
a Lucullo coeptos’ 11. 1, 1. The word
does not in such places imply incom-

leteness of work, but rather the capa-
ility of extension. Nipp. ·

4. scindit, ⁸ penetrates‚’ or ⁶ passes
through? It is hardly likely that this
first march, ‘propero agmine,’ through a
forest within the ‘limes,’ involved any
considerable clearance of obstacles, such
as Caecina was sent on to effect in the
further march; nor need we suppose that
the ‘limes’ had to be cut away to pass

it; the probability being. as Nipp. sug·
gests, that such a barrier had passages at
one or more points secured by forts.

in limste. Walther and others take
this to mean ‘ touching the barrier‚’ i. e.
so that it formed one side of the camp.

quency of this poetical or Greek accus. 'm
Tacitus, see Introd. v. ξ 11.

5. concaedibus. The word appears
to be found only in Vegetius and Am-
mianus, but such bam'cades of felled
trees to protect the flanks are described
in Caes. B. G. 3. 29. 1.

saltus obscuros. ,
tween the ‘limes' and the ‘Marsi' (see
below). Ritter suggests a locality snit-
able to the narrative, in the ‘Haardt-
Gebirge‚' near Dorsten‚ between the
Lippe and Ruhr. We have no means
of knowledge as to the two roads from
this point to the Marsi. Those suggested
by Klostermeyer (ap. Rupert.) are routes
suitable to longer expeditioris.

7. incautum. This passive sense is
found in poets; also in Sallust (‘ inmixtos
agros invasit’ H. Fr. inc. 46 D, 12 K,
3, 71 G), and Livy (⁴ quod neglexeris in-
cautum . . . habeas’ 25. 38, 14).

8. cetera, in contrast with ‘delecta
longiore via.’

9. sollemnibus epulis ludicram, ⁴ a
night of games at the festival banquet.'
The great national game of the Germans
is described in G. 24, 1 ‘genus specta-
culorum unum atque in omni coetu
idem. Nudi iuvenes, quibus id ludicrum
est. inter gladios se atque infestas frameas
saltu iaciunt.’
