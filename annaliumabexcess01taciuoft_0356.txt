CORNELII TA CJTJ ΑΝΝΑ LJUM

[A. U. C, 772.

75. At Agrippina, quamquam defessa luctu et corpore aegro, l
omnium tamen quae ultionem morarentur intolerans, ascendit
classem cum cineribus Germanici et liberis, miserantibus cunctis,
quod femina nobilitate princeps, pulcherrimo modo matrimonio

5 inter- venerantis gratantisque aspici solita, tunc feralis reliquias
sinu ferret, incerta ultionis, anxia sui et infelici fecunditate

fortunae totiens obnoxia.

Pisonem interim apud Coum insulam 2

nuntius adsequitur excessisse Germanicum. quo intemperanter3
accepto caedit victimas, adit templa, neque ipse gaudium mode-
10 rans et magis insolescente Plancina, quae luctum amissae sororis

tum primum laeto cultu mutavit.

76. Adfluebant centuriones monebantque prompta illi legio-1
num studia: repeteret provinciam non iure ablatam et vacuam.
igitur quid agendum consultanti M. Piso filius properandum ins

Ι5 urbem censebat: nihil adhuc inexpiabile admissum, neque sus· ¹

pitiones inbecillas aut inania famae pertimescenda.

and an indictment. ’ The latter term com-
prehends the former.

receptos: so 4. 21, 4; cp. ‘recipi
inter reos' 3. 70, 2. The accuser is said

‘deferre,‘ the praetor‘ recipere nomen)
That this aetion of the accusers, before
any formal charge was laid, was irregular,
is here admitted by the historian, and is
implied in the retort of Piso (c. 79, 2).

instruebant. ‘Instruere causam’ is
the regular legal term, and the evidence
and other documents are termed ‘ instru-
menta’ (Paul. Dig. 22. 4, 1).

4. pulcherrimo modo matrimonio.
Nipp. takes this as a causal abl. (ep.
Introd. v. 5 30), but it would seem
simpler to take it as a brachylogical abl.
of quality (Id. ξ 29).

5. gratantis. This poetieal verb is
adopted (6. 21, 53 12. 7, 33 14. 8, 2,
etc.) from Livy (7. 13, 10, etc.)‚ and ap-
parently preferred by Tacitus to ‘gra-
tulor.’

6. ineerta ultionis, anxia sui. On
these genitives, see 1ntrod.v. 33 d γ.

‘'Incertus has this construction (cp. 6.
46, 5)inLivy,‘anxius’ (cp.4. 12, 63 59.
4, etc.) ιιι P1.mai.‚ and both ιιι poetS.

7. fortunae totiens obnoxia, ‘had
given so many hostages to fortune; ’ i. e.
she could be attacked through each one
of her children. ‘Obnoxius’ often means

‘liable to attack,' e. g. 3. 58, 43 14. 40,
1· , 15. 38, 4, etc.

discordiam 3

Coum, Kos, north of Rhodes, with
a chief town of the same name, often
now called‘ Stanko' (ἐς τὴν Κῶ). Piso
had lest Syria (c. 70, 4); these islands
being partos the province of Asia: see
Marquardt, Staatsv. i. p. 190.

8. excessisse: cp. 1. 5, 6, etc.

9. neque . . . moderans. These words,
which seem superfluous. are taken by
Nipp. to refer to his subsequent conduct,
and to distinguish it from the still more 3,
demonstrative behaviour of Plancina.

10. insolescente ε cp. e. 63, 5. ᾗ

luctum, used of mourning dress in Cic. {j
Sest. 14, 32- etc. ζζ

1 1 . laeto cultu. i.e. resumin g gay colom-s, ᾖ
jewels‚ etc.. · cp the opposite term ‘cultu Γ
lugubri’ (13. 32, 5). J
12. centuriones, i..e those of Syria, ξ
who were mostly his creatures· cp. ο. Ξ
55 4·

prompta‚‘ ready to serve him.· ,with ς,
dat.‚ as c. 78. 1 ς 4. 60. 5.

13. non iure: see c. 77. 1, and noteson
0, Ἡ 74-1. e·
7 14. consultanti. It seems best to ’
suppose that ‘censeo ' has here the force >
and construction os ‘suadeo, ' as in cie. ⁷
Fam. 9. 2, 4 (⁴ tibi igitur hoc censeo '.) Ξ
Ιιι a somewhat similar passage in 11. 3, 1 2
ι(“ consultanti super absolutione Asiatici ’

.permisit '),‘ permisit is equivalentto :32

‘permittendum suas it.' For a different ἶ

explanation, see N ipp. here. ι»
