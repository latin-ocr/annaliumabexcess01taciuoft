= v to extend, selected him, a young man of from twenty-three
twenty-five, as his son-in-law1. The rank, and the personal cha-
11 a of Agricola, J’ustisy us in assuming, that the chosen husband of
'g daughter would be a young man not only of moral excellence, but
already assured position and promise.
,ξ Probably, two years later, he entered the senate as quaestor ¹. By
4] - age of thirty-four or thirty-six, he had attained, besides the praetor-
‘2²' ·, a place among the ‘Quindecimviri sacris faciundis ⁸,' one of the
ἰ priestly colleges, the members of which were generally men of good
and family.
ζ Up to this time Tacitus may be assumed to have lived in Rome,
” ι ·yed chiefly in the forensic practice, his eminence in which has
ἑ -- n described by Pliny, perhaps also occupied· in such literary work
³ could be sasely pursued, or in collecting material for greater things

‘a During the next sour years, from 842 to 846, Λ..ι) 89 to 93, he was
11·- nt from Rome⁴, probably in some provincial command, or as
legatus legionis. It has been suggested, that at this time he may

3⁸4⁶ to 849, Α. n. 93 to 96, he appears to describe as an eye-witness³.
Hitherto he must have been acceptable to the princes under whom
J he had lived⁸; and even in these last years he appears, by his own
J- confession, to have shown no more courage or independence than the
sest of the senate, with whom, in his seif— reproach, he identifies him-

&period will be round traceable in all his writings, and strengthened,
rather tha- weakened, by the force of timet 1t is hardly to be
” vondered at, that one who had lived through such scenes should be
⁷ bunted through lise by the spectre of Domitian.
ἕ* In 850, mn. 9¹1, he attained consular rank, as ‘suffectum’ on the
&sui os Verginius Rufus, whose funeral eulogy he delivered ⁹. It is
s afficient evidence of his position, that he was chosen successor to
J' Verginius and colleague of Nerva.
