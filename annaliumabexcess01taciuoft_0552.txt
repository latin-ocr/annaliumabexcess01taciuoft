nihil mutata amoenitate vitae, magnitudinem negotiorum per
literas excusavit, honoresque memoriae eius ab senatu large

priscum ad morem. The notion of this word only of places (as 14. 31, 75

a verb denoting approximation is sup-
plied from the sense.

2. comis, ‘affable.’

mater inpotens, ‘as a mother, im-
perious2' cp. 1. 4, 53 4. 57, 4; also the
use of ‘inpotentia' in 12. 57, 53 14. 31,
5; G. 35, 3; and of‘ inpotens ’ in G. 36,
1. From denoting absence of sels-control,
the word in such places takes the more
special sense of violent assertion of self-
will. Others, aster J. F. Gron., take it
less well to denote her extravagant fur-
therance of her son's interests.

3. uxor facilis, ‘as Aa wife, compliant.'
A special allusion seems intended to her
connivance at her husband's laxity in pri-
vate life (Suet. Aug. 71 3 Dio, 58. 2, ·5):
cp. 4. 2, 43 and ‘facilitas' 2. 65, 3; 6.

*garizi-bus, ‘subtilty.’ His many-sided
genius for intrigue and diplomacy is con-
trasted with the mere reserve and hypo-
crisy attributed to Tiberius.

from the arena: cp. ‘ vir fortis cum mala

fortuna compositus’ (Seu. Prov. 2, 9) ; ‘ut
non compositi melius cum Bitho Bac-

chius· (Hor. Sat. 1. 7, 19); also the use
of ‘comparatur' in 4. 28, 2. ‘Ulixes

great-grandson Gaius (Suet. Cal. 23). On

55, 5) to denote a 1ax, sels-indulgent lise.

9. excusavit, ‘pleaded in excuse ; ’ as
in 3. 11, 2, etc. It is stated by Suetonius
(Tib. 51) that he had only seen her once
for a few hours during the last three yearS,
and never during her last illness ; and that
her funeral was improperly delayed in ex· ⁷

a public funeral, and the erection of a few ·
statues and other trifling memoria153 but 2,
that the senate, out of genuine gratitude ᾖ
for her protection and liberality, went g
further, and prescribed a year’s φοῦ-[Ὗ ””

honoured. ἔ
