1. tertium consul. In 702, B.C. 52,
Pompeius was created consul ‘absens et
solus, quod nulli alii umquam contigit’
(Liv. Epit. B. 107). ,He was appointed
vississffissndsssseffiissiusat 2522..ssss 3531&
He retained the proconsulate of Spain
with this virtual dictatorship, which from
the first of August became an ordinary
consulship, by being shared with Q. Me-
tellus Scipio. On the history of the year,
see Mommsen, Hist. B. v. ch. 8; Watson,
select Letters of Cicero, Introd. to Part
ii (where full references to authorities are

gl 2. >gravior remediis, etc. ς by hisse-
vere and retrospective laws ‘ de vi’ and
‘de ambitu3’ by the trials held· under
them; by his military rule in Rome; by
overawing the court on the trial of Milo
by presence of a guard (see references
above). Tacitus, who elsewhere calls
Pompeius ‘occultior‚ non melior' (sc.
‘Mario et Sulla ’), had formed a very
different estimate of him from Livy (see
below, 4. 34, 4); but appears to show no
real perception of the magnitude of the
evils which had then to be dealt with:
see Merivale, ch. xiii. p. 46.

3. auctor . . . subversor. In viola-
tion of his own laws against riot and cor-
ruption, he sent into court a written com-
mendation in favour of Plancus Bursa,
and prevented the conviction of his
father-in-law Scipio. Also, in violation
of his law ‘ de iure magistratuum,‘ which
provided that candidates should canvass
in person, and that five years should in-
tervene between the tenure of office at
Rome and the government of a province;
he secured for himself for another five
years the government of Spain, and was
a party to the dispensation from personal
canvass given to Caesar. See the autho-
rities referred to in Wats0n‚ 1. 1.

quae armis tuebatur. This refers
not only to his military rule during his
consulship (see above), but also to his

sition afterwards with ‘proconsulare

imperium’ outside the gates of Rome

(Caes. B. G. 6. 1, 2), and to the troops
held in his name by his legati in Spain
(Id. B. C. 1. 85, 8; Vell. 2. 48, 1).

4. per viginti annos, from Phar-
salia ιο the sixth consulship of Augustus,
706-726, Β. c. 48-28· It is indeed as-
tonishing, that Tacitus should regard the
dictatorship of Caesar as merely part of
this general anarchy, and that in a review
of Roman legislation his ⁴ Iuliae·
should be altogether ignored. For an
account of them, see Watson, Part iv.
Appendix ix. That the triumvirate should
be also thus dealt with is not remarkable,
owing to the general cancelling of its
enactments by Augustus, as here men-
tioned. On some of its usurpations, es-
pecially that of the appointment of ma-
gistragtes‚ ⁴see Mommsen, Staatsr. ii. p.
711, 77·

non mos, non ius, sc. ‘fuitss ‘there
was neither morality nor law!

5. inpune, sc. ‘fuere : ' 1. 72, 3.

6. sexto demum consulatu. It was
in this year that the acts of the triumvi-
rate were cancelled at a stroke (Dio, 53.
2, 5), and the foundations laid of the

but the laws of which Tacitus 'speaks
were mostly of later date.

potentiae securus. The genitive with
‘ securus ’ is poetical and post-Augustan,
and usually denotas the evil or danger
against which precaution is not taken.
As an instance apposite to the use here,
Mr. Dallin notes ‘ securus veniae' in Luc.
8, 784 ; so here, ‘ sure of his ascendancy.'

7. triumviratu, abl. of time during
which (cp. Introd. v. ξ 26).

dedit iura, ‘established principles of
law: or ‘imposed a constitution. The
authority ‘dare leges‘ belonged regular-
ly, in respect of ‘socii‚’ to Romans pos-
sessed of ‘ imperium' (see Introd. vi. p.
73; Mommsen, Staatsr. ii. p. 852, etc.)-
‘ Iura dare ’ is perhaps more strictly used
of the magistrate* administering the law
by jurisdiction (cp. Verg. Aen. 8, 670);
but, in ‚the sense given above, Romulus
