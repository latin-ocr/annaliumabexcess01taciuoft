1. abstitit. This is generally read,
aster Lips., sor the MS.. ‘adstitit‚' the
death being more a reason why the sol-
diers- should go away than come up.
Whether as guards or executioners, they
had nothing lest to do.

general mle at this time, the property of
those who anticipated condemnation by
suicide was not confiscated (6. 29, 2); but
their accusers were entitled to a share (4.
30, 3), amounting as a legal minimum to
one-fourth, but capable of increase by
decree (4. 20, 2). If therefore, as seems
here to be implied, the whole was divided

accusers of senatorial rank appear to be
four (c. 3ο, 1), of whom Vibius (see on 4.
29, 4) seems not to have shared this privi-

to have been (whether from his mother’ s
side or from adoption) ’.Μ Aurelius

his brgther (Vell. 2. 112, 2), on whom

Brutus and Cassius were not borne (3.

praenomen (cp. 3. 17, 8) or‘ cognomen’
(as here) of the condemned to his
